The answer can be written as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$? \\boxed{11}\n\nAssistant: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much juice Mrs. Jones should pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice.\n\n1. Let's denote the total amount of juice in the four glasses as 4 units (since each glass is identical and the total amount of juice is 4 glasses).\n2. The first three glasses are completely full, so each of these glasses has 1 unit of juice.\n3. The fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, so it has $\\frac{1}{3}$ units of juice.\n4. The total amount of juice in the four glasses is $1 + 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = 3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}$ units.\n5. To have the same amount of juice in each glass, each glass should have $\\frac{10/3}{4} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$ units of juice.\n6. The first three glasses need to give up some juice to the fourth glass. Each of the first three glasses needs to give up $1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$ units of juice to the fourth glass.\n7. Therefore, Mrs. Jones should pour $\\frac{1}{6}$ units of juice from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{1}{6}$ is already in its simplest form, so $m = 1$ and $n = 6$. Thus, $m + n = 1 + 6 = 7$.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Total amount of juice in the four glasses\ntotal_juice = 4\n\n# Amount of juice in the first three glasses\njuice_first_three_glasses = 3 * 1\n\n# Amount of juice in the fourth glass\njuice_fourth_glass = 1 / 3\n\n# Total amount of juice in all four glasses\ntotal_juice_in_glasses = juice_first_three_glasses + juice_fourth_glass\n\n# Amount of juice each glass should have\njuice_per_glass = total_juice_in_glasses / 4\n\n# Amount of juice to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass\njuice_to_pour = 1 - juice_per_glass\n\n# Simplifying the fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\njuice_to_pour_fraction = Fraction(juice_to_pour).limit_denominator()\n\n# Extracting m and n\nm, n = juice_to_pour_fraction.numerator, juice_to_pour_fraction.denominator\n\n# Calculating m + n\nresult = m + n\nprint(result)\n```\n```output\n7\n```\nThe fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{6}$.

Let's denote the center of the smaller circle (radius 4) as $(4, 0)$ and the center of the larger circle (radius 10) as $(0, 10)$. The equations of the circles are:\n1. $(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16$\n2. $x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100$\n\nTo find the points of intersection, we solve these equations simultaneously. First, we expand the equations:\n1. $x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16 \\implies x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0$\n2. $x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100 \\implies x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0$\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n$(x^2 + y^2 - 20y) - (x^2 - 8x + y^2) = 0 \\implies 8x - 20y = 0 \\implies 2x = 5y \\implies x = \\frac{5y}{2}$\n\nSubstitute $x = \\frac{5y}{2}$ into the first equation:\n$\\left(\\frac{5y}{2}\\right)^2 - 8\\left(\\frac{5y}{2}\\right) + y^2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{25y^2}{4} - 20y + y^2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{25y^2 + 4y^2}{4} - 20y = 0 \\implies \\frac{29y^2}{4} - 20y = 0 \\implies y\\left(\\frac{29y}{4} - 20\\right) = 0$\n\nThis gives us two solutions for $y$: $y = 0$ and $y = \\frac{80}{29}$. \n\nFor $y = 0$, $x = \\frac{5 \\cdot 0}{2} = 0$.

Let's denote the roots by \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:\n\n1. \\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -a\\)\n2. \\(r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = b\\)\n3. \\(r_1r_2r_3 = -6\\)\n\nWe need to find all sets of distinct integers \\((r_1, r_2, r_3)\\) whose product is \\(-6\\). The possible sets of distinct integer roots are the permutations of the factorizations of \\(-6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (1, 2, -3), \\\\\n& (1, -2, 3), \\\\\n& (-1, 2, 3), \\\\\n& (-1, -2, -3), \\\\\n& (1, -1, 6), \\\\\n& (1, 1, -6), \\\\\n& (-1, -1, 6), \\\\\n& (-1, 1, -6), \\\\\n& (2, -2, 3), \\\\\n& (2, 2, -3), \\\\\n& (-2, -2, 3), \\\\\n& (-2, 2, -3).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the roots are distinct. So we can eliminate the sets with repeated roots. The valid sets are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& (1, 2, -3), \\\\\n& (1, -2, 3), \\\\\n& (-1, 2, 3), \\\\\n& (-1, -2, -3).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nFor each set of roots, we can calculate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using Vieta's formulas. Let's do this for each set:\n\n1. For \\((1, 2, -3)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   a &= -(1 + 2 - 3) = 0, \\\\\n   b &= 1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot (-3) + (-3) \\cdot 1 = 2 - 6 - 3 = -7.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (0, -7)\\).\n\n2. For \\((1, -2, 3)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   a &= -(1 - 2 + 3) = -2, \\\\\n   b &= 1 \\cdot (-2) + (-2) \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 1 = -2 - 6 + 3 = -5.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (-2, -5)\\).\n\n3. For \\((-1, 2, 3)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   a &= -(-1 + 2 + 3) = -4, \\\\\n   b &= (-1) \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot (-1) = -2 + 6 - 3 = 1.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (-4, 1)\\).\n\n4. For \\((-1, -2, -3)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   a &= -(-1 - 2 - 3) = 6, \\\\\n   b &= (-1) \\cdot (-2) + (-2) \\cdot (-3) + (-3) \\cdot (-1) = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11.\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n   So, \\((a, b) = (6, 11)\\).\n\nThus, the ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) are \\((0, -7)\\), \\((-2, -5)\\), \\((-4, 1)\\), and \\((6, 11)\\). There are 4 such pairs.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.

This means that no matter where the hidden rectangle is, at least one of our guesses must be covered by it.\n\n4. **Using Symmetry and Coverage:**\n   - By symmetry, we can see that guessing the center square (the middle square of the grid) is a good starting point because it is covered in 4 out of the 12 possible configurations (2 horizontal and 2 vertical).\n   - After guessing the center square, we need to cover the remaining configurations.
