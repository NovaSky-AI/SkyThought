If $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ are pairwise distinct points in the open unit interval $(0,1)$, then some $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$.\n\n\n\nLemma 2.

Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$"], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine the largest real number \\(\\mu\\) such that for every \\(4n\\)-point configuration \\(C\\) in an open unit square \\(U\\), there exists an open rectangle in \\(U\\) whose sides are parallel to those of \\(U\\) and which contains exactly one point of \\(C\\) and has an area greater than or equal to \\(\\mu\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Divide the Unit Square into Smaller Squares:**\n   Divide the unit square \\(U\\) into \\(4n\\) smaller squares of equal area.

Since no subcollection of $\\mathcal{B}$ is tight, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight, and since the union of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ does not contain $x$, some $x^{\\prime}$ in $X$ is covered by a single member of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In other words, there is a single set in $\\mathcal{B}$ covering $x^{\\prime}$ but not $x$. In this case, draw an arrow from $x$ to $x^{\\prime}$. Since there is at least one arrow from each $x$ in $X$, some of these arrows form a (minimal) cycle $x_{1} \\rightarrow x_{2} \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow x_{k} \\rightarrow x_{k+1}=x_{1}$ for some suitable integer $k \\geq 2$.

Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.

Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$.

Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$.

If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

The key is to ensure that the placement of dominoes in the upper rows does not interfere with the placement in the bottom row and does not form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square.\n\nOne effective way to place the dominoes in the upper rows is to alternate the placement of dominoes in a checkerboard pattern, ensuring that no two dominoes form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square. Specifically, we can place the dominoes in the upper rows such that each row is a shifted version of the previous row. This means that if the first row above the bottom row has dominoes placed horizontally in the first and third columns, the second row above the bottom row will have dominoes placed horizontally in the second and fourth columns, and so on.\n\nThis pattern ensures that no two dominoes form a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square and that the maximum number of dominoes can be placed.

In both cases, exactly one of the pairs $(x, y),(y, z)$ and $(z, x)$ belongs to the set $R \\times B$.

Let points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ lie respectively on sides $B C, C A, A B$ of a triangle $A B C$. Then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\geq \\min \\left\\{\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right],\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right],\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. Let $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ be the midpoints of sides $B C, C A$ and $A B$, respectively.\n\nSuppose that two of points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ lie in one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ (for convenience, let points $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ lie in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$; see Figure 2). Let segments $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A A_{1}$ intersect at point $X$. Then $X$ also lies in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$. Hence $A_{1} X \\geq A X$, and we have\n$$\n\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} A_{1} X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A_{1} X C_{1}}{\\frac{1}{2} A X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A X B_{1}}=\\frac{A_{1} X}{A X} \\geq 1\n$$\nas required.\n\nOtherwise, each one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}, C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ contains exactly one of points $A_{1}$, $B_{1}, C_{1}$, and we can assume that $B A_{1}<B A^{\\prime}, C B_{1}<C B^{\\prime}, A C_{1}<A C^{\\prime}$ (see Figure 3). Then lines $B_{1} A_{1}$ and $A B$ intersect at a point $Y$ on the extension of $A B$ beyond point $B$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{C_{1} Y}{C^{\\prime} Y}>1$; also, lines $A_{1} C^{\\prime}$ and $C A$ intersect at a point $Z$ on the extension of $C A$ beyond point $A$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{B_{1} Z}{B^{\\prime} Z}>1$. Finally, since $A_{1} A^{\\prime} \\| B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$, we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$.\n\n\n\nNow, from $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]+\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]=[A B C]$ we obtain that one of the remaining triangles $A C_{1} B_{1}, B A_{1} C_{1}, C B_{1} A_{1}$ has an area less than $\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, so it is less than $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$.\n\nNow we return to the problem. We say that triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small if $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is less than each of $\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$; otherwise this triangle is big (the similar notion is introduced for triangles $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}, C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}, D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ ). If both triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}$ are big, then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of some border triangle, and $\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of another one; hence, $S_{1}=\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right] \\geq S$. The same is valid for the pair of $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$. So it is sufficient to prove that in one of these pairs both triangles are big.\n\nSuppose the contrary. Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small. We can assume also that $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq$ $\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]$. Note that in this case ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$.\n\nConsider two cases.\n\n<img_3464>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3580>\n\nFigure 5\n\nCase 1. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ intersects line $A B$ at some point $K$. Let ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersect line $B C$ at point $L$ (see Figure 4). Then we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right],\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ (both - since $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is small), and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[A A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ (since triangle $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ is small). This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a \"sufficiently far\" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$. Then analogously we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ since triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small.

Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$. Note that there exists a prime $q \\mid n$, so by the Lemma $q \\mid k$ and $k>1$.\n\nIf $k>n$ then $k-n+1>1$, and there exists a prime $p \\mid k-n+1$; we have $k \\equiv n-1$ $(\\bmod p)$.

Considering all possible napkin configurations, what is the largest value of $k$ ?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3986729", "unit": null, "solution": ["Let $m=39$, then $2011=52 m-17$. We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.", "We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$.

The upper-left block is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe system of blocks has the following properties..\n\n$\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ If $(i, j)$ is a B-block then $(i+1, j)$ is a B-block: otherwise the kings in these two blocks can take each other. Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns. So we have a unique arrangement of blocks that leads to the arrangement of kings satisfying the condition of the problem (see Fig. 3).\n\n<img_4043>\n\nFig. 3\n\n<img_3321>\n\nFig. 4\n\nCase 2. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column. Repeating the arguments from Case 1, we obtain that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are L-rows (and all other rows are R-rows), the columns from the 1st to the 25th are B-columns (and all other columns are T-columns), so we find exactly one more arrangement of kings (see Fig. 4)."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem of placing 2500 chess kings on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard such that no two kings can capture each other and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings, we need to carefully analyze the constraints and the structure of the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints:\n1. No two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex. This means that no two kings can be placed in squares that are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n2. Each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can infer that the kings must be placed in a pattern that ensures no two kings are adjacent. One such pattern is to place the kings in a checkerboard-like pattern, but with a specific offset to ensure that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.\n\nConsider a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard. If we place the kings in a pattern where each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent, we can use a specific offset pattern. One such pattern is to place the kings in the squares \\((i, j)\\) where \\(i + j \\equiv k \\pmod{4}\\) for some fixed \\(k\\). This ensures that no two kings are adjacent and each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.\n\nTo verify, let's consider the pattern where \\(i + j \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}\\).

This pattern ensures that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings, and no two kings are adjacent.\n\nSince the pattern is fixed and there are no other possible patterns that satisfy both conditions (each row and each column containing exactly 25 kings and no two kings being adjacent), the number of such arrangements is simply the number of ways to choose the initial offset, which is 4 (since \\(k\\) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3).\n\nTherefore, the number of such arrangements is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\n\nLemma. Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion.", "Let the terms odd triangle and iso-odd triangle have the same meaning as in the first solution.\n\nLet $A B C$ be an iso-odd triangle, with $A B$ and $B C$ odd sides. This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between $A$ and $B$ and also between $B$ and $C$. We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side. It follows that at most 1003 iso-odd triangles can appear in the dissection.\n\nThis value can be attained, as shows the example from the first solution."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in a regular 2006-gon. Let's start by analyzing the conditions for a diagonal to be odd.\n\nA diagonal of a regular 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if a diagonal connects vertices \\(A_i\\) and \\(A_j\\), the number of sides between \\(A_i\\) and \\(A_j\\) in both directions must be odd. This implies that the length of the diagonal (the number of sides between the endpoints, considering the shorter path) must be odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangles formed by the dissection of the 2006-gon into 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. Each triangle will have three sides, and we are interested in the isosceles triangles with two odd sides. In a regular 2006-gon, an isosceles triangle with two odd sides must have its base as an even diagonal (since the sum of the lengths of the two odd sides must be even, and the only way this can happen in a regular polygon is if the base is an even diagonal).\n\nTo maximize the number of such isosceles triangles, we need to consider the structure of the dissection.

This means that the numbers in the same column for any two rows cannot be consecutive integers.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Table\nTo maximize \\( N \\), we need to find a way to arrange the rows such that the second property is satisfied. One effective way to do this is to use a combinatorial design known as a \"transversal design\" or a \"difference set\".\n\n### Step 4: Using a Difference Set\nA difference set can be used to ensure that the rows are sufficiently different. Specifically, we can use a difference set of size 50 in the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\). A difference set of size 50 in a set of size 100 ensures that for any two elements in the set, their difference (modulo 100) is unique.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Rows\nWe can construct 50 rows such that each row is a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) and the difference between any two elements in the same column is at least 2. This can be done by using a specific construction method for difference sets.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the Construction\nTo verify, consider the following:\n- Each row is a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 100\\}\\).\n- For any two rows, there exists a column where the difference between the numbers is at least 2.\n\nThis construction ensures that the second property is satisfied.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nThe largest \\( N \\) for which such a table exists is 50.

We distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1: $X \\cap M_{1} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nA cube from $X \\cap M_{1}$ should appear in all three boxes $X, Y$, and $Z$, so it should lie in $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$. Thus $X \\cap M_{1}=X \\cap Y \\cap Z$ and $\\left|X \\cap M_{1}\\right|=1$.\n\nConsider now the cubes in $X \\cap M_{2}$. There are at most $2(n-1)$ of them lying in $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$ (because the cube from $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$ is in $M_{1}$ ). Let $a$ be some other cube from $X \\cap M_{2}$. Recall that there is just one other cube $a^{\\prime}$ sharing a color with $a$. But both $Y$ and $Z$ should contain such cube, so $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (but $a^{\\prime} \\notin X \\cap Y \\cap Z$ ). The map $a \\mapsto a^{\\prime}$ is clearly injective, so the number of cubes $a$ we are interested in does not exceed $|(Y \\cap Z) \\backslash X|=n-1$. Thus $\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant 2(n-1)+(n-1)=3(n-1)$, and hence $4\\left|X \\cap M_{1}\\right|+\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant 4+3(n-1)=3 n+1$.\n\nCase 2: $X \\cap M_{1}=\\varnothing$.\n\nIn this case, the same argument applies with several changes. Indeed, $X \\cap M_{2}$ contains at most $2 n-1$ cubes from $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$. Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them. All this results in $\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant(2 n-1)+n=3 n-1$, which is even better than we need (by the assumptions of our case).\n\nSumming up the inequalities from the Claim over all $x$-boxes $X$, we obtain\n\n$$\n4 n_{1}+n_{2} \\leqslant n(3 n+1) .\n$$\n\nObviously, we also have $n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n^{3}$.\n\nNow we are prepared to estimate $C$. Due to the definition of the $M_{i}$, we have $n_{i} \\geqslant i\\left|\\mathcal{C}_{i}\\right|$, so\n\n$$\nC \\leqslant n_{1}+\\frac{n_{2}}{2}+\\frac{n_{3}}{3}=\\frac{n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}}{3}+\\frac{4 n_{1}+n_{2}}{6} \\leqslant \\frac{n^{3}}{3}+\\frac{3 n^{2}+n}{6}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6} .\n$$\n\nIt remains to present an example of an appropriate coloring in the above-mentioned number of colors. For each color, we present the set of all cubes of this color.

Finally, we require that, for every non-empty set in any group, the same set must appear in the other 2 groups. What is the maximum number of colors present with these new requirements?\n\nLet us call strange a big $n \\times n \\times n$ cube whose painting scheme satisfies the new requirements, and let $D$ be the number of colors in a strange cube.

Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for $B$ still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in $B$ only matched $X, Y$ or $Z$ before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, $B$ is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that $B$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}$ colors.

We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points.

The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

However, the key observation is that the process will eventually reach a stable state where no butterfly is lonely. This is because the number of butterflies in the neighborhood of any point can only decrease or stay the same as butterflies fly away, and once a butterfly is not lonely, it will not become lonely again unless more butterflies fly away from its neighborhood.\n\nIn the final stable state, the number of butterflies in the neighborhood of each remaining butterfly must be at least \\(2n^2 + 2n\\). This means that each remaining butterfly must be comfortable or crowded.

The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation.

A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the tangent segments and how they can be drawn between the circles.

We claim that the required partition exists and is unique. The two diagonals of the board divide the board into four regions. Note that the domino covering cell $(1,1)$ must be vertical.

Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\\[ \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, (a^2 + 3a + 3) - (a^2 + a + 1)) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2a + 2) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2(a + 1)) \\]\nSince \\( a^2 + a + 1 \\) is always odd, \\( \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2(a + 1)) = 1 \\) if \\( a + 1 \\) is odd, and \\( \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, 2(a + 1)) = 2 \\) if \\( a + 1 \\) is even. However, \\( a^2 + a + 1 \\) is never even, so the gcd is always 1. Therefore, \\( P(a) \\) and \\( P(a+1) \\) do not share a common factor, and the set \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1)\\} \\) is not fragrant.\n\n### Step 3: Check for \\( b = 3 \\)\nFor \\( b = 3 \\), the set is \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2)\\} \\). We need to check if any element in the set shares a common factor with the product of the other two elements. Let's compute \\( P(a+2) \\):\n\\[ P(a+2) = (a+2)^2 + (a+2) + 1 = a^2 + 5a + 7 \\]\nWe need to check the gcds:\n\\[ \\gcd(P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2)) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3, a^2 + 5a + 7) \\]\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, we can show that \\( \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3, a^2 + 5a + 7) = 1 \\) for most values of \\( a \\). However, we need to check specific values to ensure there is no common factor. For example, if \\( a = 1 \\):\n\\[ P(1) = 1^2 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\]\n\\[ P(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7 \\]\n\\[ P(3) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13 \\]\nHere, \\( \\gcd(3, 7, 13) = 1 \\). Therefore, the set \\( \\{P(1), P(2), P(3)\\} \\) is not fragrant.\n\n### Step 4: Check for \\( b = 4 \\)\nFor \\( b = 4 \\), the set is \\( \\{P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), P(a+3)\\} \\). We need to check if any element in the set shares a common factor with the product of the other three elements. Let's compute \\( P(a+3) \\):\n\\[ P(a+3) = (a+3)^2 + (a+3) + 1 = a^2 + 7a + 13 \\]\nWe need to check the gcds:\n\\[ \\gcd(P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), P(a+3)) = \\gcd(a^2 + a + 1, a^2 + 3a + 3, a^2 + 5a + 7, a^2 + 7a + 13) \\]\nUsing specific values, for example \\( a = 1 \\):\n\\[ P(1) = 3 \\]\n\\[ P(2) = 7 \\]\n\\[ P(3) = 13 \\]\n\\[ P(4) = 4^2 + 4 + 1 = 21 = 3 \\times 7 \\]\nHere, \\( \\gcd(3, 7, 13, 21) = 1 \\).

However, for \\( a = 4 \\):\n\\[ P(4) = 21 \\]\n\\[ P(5) = 31 \\]\n\\[ P(6) = 43 \\]\n\\[ P(7) = 7^2 + 7 + 1 = 57 = 3 \\times 19 \\]\nHere, \\( \\gcd(21, 31, 43, 57) = 1 \\).

We prove that, in fact, if a board initially contains an even number $n>1$ of ones, then $A$ can guarantee to obtain $S_{2}(n)$, but not more, cookies. The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$. Denote $s=S_{2}(n)$.\n\nLet $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}$ be the numbers on the board at some moment of the game after $B$ 's turn or at the beginning of the game.

An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.", "We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is \"on the right\" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur's actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of the labyrinth and the implications of the painting and placement of knights.

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win).

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 .

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$. But then\n\n$$\n\\mho(f(x)-f(y)) \\geqslant \\mho\\left(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\right)>\\mho(\\ell)=\\mho(x-y),\n$$\n\nwhich is impossible.\n\nNow we complete the induction step. By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

Let's use this to find a specific form of \\( f \\). Suppose \\( f(0) = c \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nf(c + n) = f(n) + 2014.\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that \\( f \\) is a linear function.

Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$.

As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II.

To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$.

Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$.

For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved.

If both $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$ this is clear.\n\nSuppose $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}>\\alpha$ is a grade.

The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points.

First, we approximate \\( \\sqrt{8085} \\):\n\\[ \\sqrt{8085} \\approx 89.92. \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ p = \\frac{-1 + 89.92}{2} \\approx 44.46. \\]\n\nSince \\( p \\) must be an integer, we check \\( p = 44 \\) and \\( p = 45 \\):\n\\[ 44^2 + 44 + 1 = 1936 + 44 + 1 = 1981, \\]\n\\[ 45^2 + 45 + 1 = 2025 + 45 + 1 = 2071. \\]\n\nSince neither 44 nor 45 satisfy the equation, we need to check if there is another form of number that could have three distinct divisors summing to 2022. Consider the possibility of a number with more than three divisors but still having exactly three distinct divisors summing to 2022. This would mean the number is not of the form \\( p^2 \\) but could be a product of two distinct primes \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that the divisors are \\( 1, p, q, pq \\) and we need to find a combination where the sum of three of these is 2022.\n\nLet's try \\( n = pq \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are distinct primes. The divisors are \\( 1, p, q, pq \\). We need to find \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that:\n\\[ 1 + p + q = 2022 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1 + p + pq = 2022 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1 + q + pq = 2022. \\]\n\nFirst, consider \\( 1 + p + q = 2022 \\):\n\\[ p + q = 2021. \\]\n\nWe need to find two prime numbers that sum to 2021. Checking pairs of primes, we find:\n\\[ 2017 + 4 = 2021, \\]\nbut 4 is not a prime. The next pair is:\n\\[ 2011 + 10 = 2021, \\]\nbut 10 is not a prime.

We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine.

By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$.

This means a knight can attack up to 8 squares on a standard chessboard.\n\n2. **Placing Knights**:\n   Horst places a black knight on an empty square such that it does not attack any previously placed knights.

Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly).

Thus, $f$ would be $m$-periodic and, consequently, bounded. Let $B$ be a bound, $f(x) \\leq B$. If we choose $x>2 B$ we obtain the contradiction $x>2 B \\geq f(y)+f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\nStep 2. For all positive integers $z$, we have $f(f(z))=z$.\n\nSetting $x=z$ and $y=1$ this follows immediately from Step 1 .\n\nStep 3. For all integers $z \\geq 1$, we have $f(z) \\leq z$.\n\nLet us show, that the contrary leads to a contradiction. Assume $w+1=f(z)>z$ for some $z$. From Step 1 we know that $w \\geq z \\geq 2$. Let $M=\\max \\{f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(w)\\}$ be the largest value of $f$ for the first $w$ integers. First we show, that no positive integer $t$ exists with\n\n$$\nf(t)>\\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M,\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\notherwise we decompose the smallest value $t$ as $t=w r+s$ where $r$ is an integer and $1 \\leq s \\leq w$. Because of the definition of $M$, we have $t>w$. Setting $x=z$ and $y=t-w$ we get from the triangle inequality\n\n$$\nz+f(t-w)>f((t-w)+f(z)-1)=f(t-w+w)=f(t)\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nf(t-w) \\geq f(t)-(z-1)>\\frac{z-1}{w}(t-w)+M\n$$\n\na contradiction to the minimality of $t$.\n\nTherefore the inequality (1) fails for all $t \\geq 1$, we have proven\n\n$$\nf(t) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\ninstead.\n\n\n\nNow, using (2), we finish the proof of Step 3. Because of $z \\leq w$ we have $\\frac{z-1}{w}<1$ and we can choose an integer $t$ sufficiently large to fulfill the condition\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}\\right)^{2} t+\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}+1\\right) M<t .\n$$\n\nApplying (2) twice we get\n\n$$\nf(f(t)) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} f(t)+M \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w}\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w} t+M\\right)+M<t\n$$\n\nin contradiction to Step 2, which proves Step 3.\n\nFinal step. Thus, following Step 2 and Step 3, we obtain\n\n$$\nz=f(f(z)) \\leq f(z) \\leq z\n$$\n\nand $f(z)=z$ for all positive integers $z$ is proven."], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To determine all functions \\( f \\) from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers such that for all \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths \\( x \\), \\( f(y) \\), and \\( f(y + f(x) - 1) \\), we need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds for these side lengths.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "996000", "unit": null, "solution": ["First we show that this number is an upper bound for the number of cells a limp rook can visit. To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$.

Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell.

A set $T \\subset S$ will be called a $k$-clique if every two points in $T$ are $k$-friends. Find the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a $k$-clique with more than 200 elements.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "180180", "unit": null, "solution": ["To begin, let us describe those points $B \\in S$ which are $k$-friends of the point $(0,0)$. By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that there exists a set \\( T \\subset S \\) (where \\( S \\) is the set of all points with integer coordinates) with more than 200 elements, where every pair of points in \\( T \\) are \\( k \\)-friends.

So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd. Select arbitrarily an even number of these $k_{\\ell}$ switches and replace each of them by the switch of lamp $n+\\ell$. This can be done in $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ ways (because a $k_{\\ell}$-element set has $2^{k_{\\ell}-1}$ subsets of even cardinality). Notice that $k_{1}+\\cdots+k_{n}=k$.\n\nThese actions are independent, in the sense that the action involving lamp $\\ell$ does not affect the action involving any other lamp. So there are $2^{k_{1}-1} \\cdot 2^{k_{2}-1} \\cdots 2^{k_{n}-1}=2^{k-n}$ ways of combining these actions. In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way. Indeed, it is enough to replace every switch of a lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ that occurs in $\\mathbf{q}$ by the switch of the corresponding lamp $\\ell-n$; in the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved.\n\nSwitches of each lamp with a label $\\ell>n$ had occurred in $\\mathbf{q}$ an even number of times. So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$.

Hence $u+v=1$ implies\n\n$$\ng(u v+3)-g(u v+1)=g(3)-g(1)\n$$\n\nEach $x \\leq 5 / 4$ is expressible in the form $x=u v+1$ with $u+v=1$ (the quadratic function $t^{2}-t+(x-1)$ has real roots for $\\left.x \\leq 5 / 4\\right)$. Hence $g(x+2)-g(x)=g(3)-g(1)$ whenever $x \\leq 5 / 4$. Because $g(x)=x$ holds for $x=0,1,2$, setting $x=0$ yields $g(3)=3$. This proves (4) for $x \\leq 5 / 4$. If $x>5 / 4$ then $-x<5 / 4$ and so $g(2-x)-g(-x)=2$ by the above. On the other hand (3) gives $g(x)=2-g(2-x), g(x+2)=2-g(-x)$, so that $g(x+2)-g(x)=g(2-x)-g(-x)=2$. Thus (4) is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow replace $x$ by $-x$ in (3) to obtain $g(-x)+g(2+x)=2$. In view of (4) this leads to $g(x)+g(-x)=0$, i. e. $g(-x)=-g(x)$ for all $x$. Taking this into account, we apply (1) to the pairs $(-x, y)$ and $(x,-y)$ :\n\n$g(1-x y)-g(-x+y)=(g(x)+1)(1-g(y)), \\quad g(1-x y)-g(x-y)=(1-g(x))(g(y)+1)$.\n\nAdding up yields $g(1-x y)=1-g(x) g(y)$. Then $g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y)$ by (3). Now the original equation (1) takes the form $g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y)$. Hence $g$ is additive.\n\nBy additvity $g(1+x y)=g(1)+g(x y)=1+g(x y)$; since $g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y)$ was shown above, we also have $g(x y)=g(x) g(y)$ ( $g$ is multiplicative). In particular $y=x$ gives $g\\left(x^{2}\\right)=g(x)^{2} \\geq 0$ for all $x$, meaning that $g(x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$. Since $g$ is additive and bounded from below on $[0,+\\infty)$, it is linear; more exactly $g(x)=g(1) x=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIn summary $f(x)=x-1, x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$.

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$. Since $y+z=503 k=503 \\cdot 2$, this leads to $5 y z=503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$. However $503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$ is not a multiple of 5 .

Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.

For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$.

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\\[10b + a = (10a + b) + 0.75(10a + b)\\]\n\\[10b + a = 1.75(10a + b)\\]\n\\[10b + a = 17.5a + 1.75b\\]\n\\[10b - 1.75b = 17.5a - a\\]\n\\[8.25b = 16.5a\\]\n\\[825b = 1650a\\]\n\\[17b = 33a\\]\n\\[b = \\frac{33a}{17}\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), \\(b\\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\(33a\\) must be divisible by 17. The smallest value of \\(a\\) that satisfies this condition is 17, but since \\(a\\) is a digit, the only possible value for \\(a\\) is 3 (because \\(33 \\times 3 = 99\\) and 99 is divisible by 17, giving \\(b = 9\\)).\n\nSo, \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 9\\). The original number is \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 3 + 9 = 39\\), and the reversed number is \\(10b + a = 10 \\times 9 + 3 = 93\\).\n\nWe need to check if 93 is indeed 75% greater than 39:\n\\[93 = 39 + 0.75 \\times 39 = 39 + 29.25 = 68.25 + 24.75 = 93\\]\n\nThis confirms that 39 is the correct original number. However, we need to find the largest two-digit number that satisfies the condition. We need to check if there are any other possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that are larger than 39. The next possible value for \\(a\\) is 6 (since \\(33 \\times 6 = 198\\) and 198 is divisible by 17, giving \\(b = 18/17 = 18/17 \\approx 10.47\\), which is not a digit).\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 9\\), giving the number 39. However, we need to check if there is a larger number that fits the criteria. The only other possible value is when \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 18/17 \\approx 10.47\\), which is not a digit. Therefore, the only valid solution is 69.\n\nSo, the largest two-digit number that becomes 75% greater when its digits are reversed is \\(\\boxed{69}\\)."], "pred": ["69"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 ."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["To determine how many of the integers \\( f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014) \\) have a units digit of 1, we need to analyze the function \\( f(n) \\), which counts the number of positive integers with exactly \\( n \\) digits whose digits sum to 5.\n\nFirst, let's consider the generating function approach.

Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\n\nWe will use two important facts:\n\n(F1) $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ for every positive integer $m \\geq 3$, and\n\n(F2) $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$ for every positive integer $k \\geq 3$\n\nFirst, we prove (F1):\n\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$. (In other words, it cannot be the case that $c=a+b-1$.) Therefore, $c-1 \\leq(a-1)+(b-1)-1$; that is, $c-1<(a-1)+(b-1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $(a-1)+(b-1)+(c-1)=2 m-3$.\n\nTherefore, $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, since it satisfies all of the conditions of $S_{2 m-3}$. Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$. We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$. This proves that $T(k) \\leq T(k+2)$.\n\nSuppose that $n=N$ is the smallest positive integer for which $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThen $N$ must be odd:\n\nIf $N$ was even, then by (F1), $T(N-3)=T(N)>2010$ and so $n=N-3$ would be an integer smaller than $N$ with $T(n)>2010$. This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 . In this case, $a=154-\\frac{1}{2} c$ and $b=155-\\frac{1}{2} c$.\n\nTherefore, if $c$ is even, there are $\\left(154-\\frac{1}{2} c\\right)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-154$ possible triples.\n\nIn general, if $c$ is odd, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible.\n\nSince $c$ is odd, then $309-c$ is even, so $a$ and $b$ can be equal. In this case, $a=\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)$. Therefore, if $c$ is odd, there are $\\frac{1}{2}(309-c)-(309-2 c)+1=\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible pairs $(a, b)$ and so $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{307}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are 104,106,...,152,154 (there are 26 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are 103,105,...,151,153 (there are 26 such values).\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(309)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-154\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-154\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(154)-154\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{307}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+154)-26 \\cdot 154+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+153+154)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+154)(52)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(26)(257)-26 \\cdot 154-26 \\cdot \\frac{307}{2} \\\\\n= & 2028\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(309)>2010$, as required.\n\nCalculation of $T(307)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{307}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{307}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 153$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=307-c$.\n\nThis can be done in a similar way to the calculation of $T(309)$ above.\n\nIf $n$ is even, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-153$ possible triples.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, there are $\\frac{3}{2} c-\\frac{305}{2}$ possible triples.\n\nThe possible even values of $c$ are $104,106, \\ldots, 150,152$ (there are 25 such values) and the possible odd values of $c$ are $103,105, \\ldots, 151,153$ (there are 26 such values).\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT(307)= & \\left(\\frac{3}{2}(104)-153\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(106)-153\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(152)-153\\right)+ \\\\\n& \\quad\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(103)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(105)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(153)-\\frac{305}{2}\\right) \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(104+106+\\cdots+152)-25 \\cdot 153+\\frac{3}{2}(103+105+\\cdots+153)-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(103+104+105+106+\\cdots+152+153)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(103+153)(51)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & \\frac{3}{2}(51)(128)-25 \\cdot 153-26 \\cdot \\frac{305}{2} \\\\\n= & 2002\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, $T(307)<2010$, as required.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$ is $n=309$.\n\nAs a final note, we discuss briefly how one could guess that the answer was near $N=309$.\n\nConsider the values of $T(n)$ for small odd positive integers $n$.\n\nIn (a), by considering the possible values of $c$ from smallest (roughly $\\frac{1}{3} n$ ) to largest (roughly $\\frac{1}{2} n$ ), we saw that $T(11)=1+3=4$.\n\nIf we continue to calculate $T(n)$ for a few more small odd values of $n$ we will see that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& T(13)=2+3=5 \\\\\n& T(15)=1+2+4=7 \\\\\n& T(17)=1+3+4=8 \\\\\n& T(19)=2+3+5=10 \\\\\n& T(21)=1+2+4+5=12 \\\\\n& T(23)=1+3+4+6=14\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nThe pattern that seems to emerge is that for $n$ odd, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$, with one out of every three integers removed. Thus, $T(n)$ is roughly equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the sum of the integers from 1 to $\\frac{1}{4} n$. Therefore, $T(n) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n+1\\right) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} n\\right)^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{48} n^{2}$.\n\nIt makes sense to look for an odd positive integer $n$ with $T(n) \\approx 2010$.\n\nThus, we are looking for a value of $n$ that roughly satisfies $\\frac{1}{48} n^{2} \\approx 2010$ or $n^{2} \\approx 96480$ or $n \\approx 310$.\n\nSince $n$ is odd, then it makes sense to consider $n=309$, as in the solution above."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( T(n) > 2010 \\), we need to count the number of triangles with integer side lengths, positive area, and perimeter \\( n \\).

Using $k=2$ makes $9 k+4$ even, yielding $22^{2}=484=9 \\cdot 53+7$, and $53+6=59$ is prime.

Then for $n=2014, a=2002$ is impossible, because $2014-2002=12$.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

Two sequences are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\nWe can use the concept of \"necklaces\" in combinatorics, which are circular arrangements of objects where rotations are considered identical. The problem can be approached using the Polya Enumeration Theorem (PET) or by direct counting, but here we will use a more straightforward combinatorial approach.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Sequences\nWe need to count the number of distinct sequences of positive integers that sum to 17.

For each choice of 8 digits, there is exactly one way to arrange them in increasing order, and this corresponds to a unique valid license plate. Therefore, the number of valid license plates is simply the number of ways to choose 8 digits out of 9, which is 9.\n\nThus, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is \\(\\boxed{362880}\\).\n\nHowever, we need to correct the interpretation. The correct approach is to consider the number of ways to choose and arrange 8 distinct digits from 1 to 9 such that the \\(k\\)-th digit is at least \\(k\\). This is equivalent to choosing 8 digits from 9 and arranging them in a specific order, which is simply the number of permutations of 8 distinct digits, which is \\(8!\\).\n\nSo, the correct number of valid license plates is \\(8! = 40320\\).\n\nThus, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is \\(\\boxed{40320}\\)."], "pred": ["40320"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

We will then compute the sum of these elements and find the remainder when this sum is divided by 10,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find integers \\( n \\) such that the last four digits of \\( n \\) in base-2 and base-5 are the same. This means:\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\nfor some integer \\( a \\) where \\( 0 \\leq a < 16 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nSince 16 and 625 are coprime, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution modulo \\( 16 \\times 625 = 10000 \\). Therefore, for each \\( a \\) from 0 to 15, there is a unique \\( n \\) modulo 10000 such that:\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{16} \\]\n\\[ n \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Solutions\nFor each \\( a \\), the solution \\( n \\) can be written as:\n\\[ n = 16k + a \\]\nfor some integer \\( k \\). We also need:\n\\[ 16k + a \\equiv a \\pmod{625} \\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[ 16k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{625} \\]\nSince 16 and 625 are coprime, \\( k \\) must be a multiple of 625. Let \\( k = 625m \\) for some integer \\( m \\). Then:\n\\[ n = 16(625m) + a = 10000m + a \\]\nThus, \\( n \\equiv a \\pmod{10000} \\).\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)\nThe elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) are:\n\\[ \\{ a, a + 10000, a + 20000, \\ldots \\} \\]\nSince we are considering integers from 0 to 9999, the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) are:\n\\[ \\{ a, a + 10000, a + 20000, \\ldots \\} \\cap [0, 9999] = \\{ a \\} \\]\nfor \\( a = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 15 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Summing the Elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\)\nThe elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) are \\( \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 15 \\} \\). The sum of these elements is:\n\\[ \\sum_{a=0}^{15} a = \\frac{15 \\times 16}{2} = 120 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Remainder\nWe need the remainder when 120 is divided by 10000:\n\\[ 120 \\mod 10000 = 120 \\]\n\nThus, the remainder when the sum of the elements of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is divided by 10,000 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"], "pred": ["120"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since \\(\\log_a \\sqrt{ab} = \\log_a (ab)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_a (ab) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_a a + \\log_a b) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\log_a b)\\) and \\(\\log_b \\sqrt{ab} = \\log_b (ab)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_b (ab) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_b a + \\log_b b) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\log_b a + 1)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} c = \\frac{\\log_a c}{\\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\log_a b)} = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\log_a b}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} d = \\frac{\\log_b d}{\\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\log_b a)} = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\log_b a}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_a b = \\frac{1}{\\log_b a}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} c = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\log_a b} = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\log_b a}} = \\frac{2T \\log_b a}{\\log_b a + 1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} d = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\log_b a}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log_b a = \\frac{1}{\\log_a b}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} c = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\log_a b} = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\frac{1}{T}} = \\frac{2T^2}{T + 1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} d = \\frac{2T}{1 + \\frac{1}{T}} = \\frac{2T^2}{T + 1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 \\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} c + 3 \\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} d = 3 \\left( \\frac{2T^2}{T + 1} + \\frac{2T^2}{T + 1} \\right) = 3 \\left( \\frac{4T^2}{T + 1} \\right) = \\frac{12T^2}{T + 1}\n\\]\n\nSo the expression we need to compute is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{12T^2}{T + 1}}{2T} = \\frac{12T^2}{2T(T + 1)} = \\frac{6T}{T + 1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"], "pred": ["6"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Each switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on at the end. Since we flip exactly 2 switches each minute, the total number of flips over all minutes must be even (since each flip is counted twice, once for each switch flipped). Therefore, the number of minutes must be even to ensure that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n\nLet's denote the number of minutes by \\( m \\). Since \\( m \\) must be even, let \\( m = 2t \\) for some integer \\( t \\). Each switch must be flipped exactly \\( 2t \\) times in total, and since \\( 2t \\) is even, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in \\( 2t \\) minutes.

Let's check if \\( m = 4 \\) (i.e., \\( t = 2 \\)) works. In 4 minutes, each switch must be flipped 4 times, which is an even number, but we need an odd number of flips for each switch to be on. Therefore, \\( m = 4 \\) is not sufficient.\n\nNext, let's check \\( m = 6 \\) (i.e., \\( t = 3 \\)). In 6 minutes, each switch must be flipped 6 times, which is an even number, but we need an odd number of flips for each switch to be on. Therefore, \\( m = 6 \\) is not sufficient.\n\nNow, let's check \\( m = 8 \\) (i.e., \\( t = 4 \\)). In 8 minutes, each switch must be flipped 8 times, which is an even number, but we need an odd number of flips for each switch to be on. Therefore, \\( m = 8 \\) is not sufficient.\n\nFinally, let's check \\( m = 6 \\) again but with a different strategy. We need to ensure that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.

Using this conclusion and because $3,4,5$ is not a lucky trio, it follows that the middle number of a lucky trio cannot be a multiple of 4 . Hence it is necessary that a lucky trio has the form $4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3$, for some positive integer $k$, with $2 k+1$ being a prime. Note that $k \\neq 1(\\bmod 3)$ because when $k=1$, the sequence $5,6,7$ is not a lucky trio, and when $k>1,4 k+2$ would be a multiple of 6 greater than 6 , hence it cannot be a semiprime. Trying $k=2,3,5,6,8,9, \\ldots$ allows one to eliminate sequences of three consecutive integers that are not lucky trios, and if lucky trios are ordered by their least elements, one finds that the first three lucky trios are 33,34,35; 85,86,87; and 93,94,95.

Thus any morphed sequence is strictly increasing.\n\n\n\nNow if the morphed sequence is an arithmetic progression, it follows from the above three observations that it must have the form\n\n$$\n(38.5-4.5 d, 38.5-3.5 d, \\ldots, 38.5+4.5 d)\n$$\n\nwhere $d$ is an odd positive integer satisfying $38.5-4.5 d>0$. Therefore the only possible values of $d$ are $7,5,3,1$; thus there are at most four possibilities for the morphed sequence, shown in the table below. Denote these four sequences by $A, B, C, D$.\n\n|  | $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $d=7:$ | $A$ | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n| $d=5:$ | $B$ | 16 | 21 | 26 | 31 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 |\n| $d=3:$ | $C$ | 25 | 28 | 31 | 34 | 37 | 40 | 43 | 46 | 49 | 52 |\n| $d=1:$ | $D$ | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 |\n\nStep 2. Given any two sequences $X=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{10}\\right)$ and $Y=\\left(y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{10}\\right)$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_{i}=385$, define the taxicab distance\n\n$$\n\\rho(X, Y)=\\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|x_{i}-y_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nObserve that if $X^{\\prime}$ is a morph of $X$, then $\\rho\\left(X^{\\prime}, Y\\right) \\geq \\rho(X, Y)-2$. Therefore the number of morphs required to transform $T$ into some sequence $Z$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, Z)$. Now\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho(T, A)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{10}\\left|i^{2}-7 i\\right|=56\n$$\n\nand also $\\rho(T, A)<\\min (\\rho(T, B), \\rho(T, C), \\rho(T, D))$. Thus at least 56 morphs are needed to obtain sequence $A$ (and more morphs would be required to obtain any of sequences $B, C$, or $D$ ).\n\nStep 3. To conclude, it remains to verify that one can make 56 morphs and arrive from $T$ to $A$. One of many possible constructions is given below.\n\n| $T$ | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 36 | 49 | 64 | 81 | 100 |\n| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 6 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 | 42 | 49 | 58 | 81 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 27 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 81 | 100 |\n| 8 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 73 | 100 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 26 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 100 |\n| 2 morphs | 1 | 4 | 9 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 98 |\n| 12 morphs | 1 | 4 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 86 |\n| 10 morphs | 1 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 76 |\n| 6 morphs | 7 | 14 | 21 | 28 | 35 | 42 | 49 | 56 | 63 | 70 |\n\nTherefore the least number of morphs needed to transform $T$ into an arithmetic progression is $\\mathbf{5 6}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to transform the sequence \\(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots, 10^2\\) into an arithmetic progression using the minimum number of morphs.

A morph replaces two terms \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a+1\\) and \\(b-1\\) if and only if \\(a+1 < b-1\\). This means that the difference between the two terms must be at least 3 for a morph to be possible.\n\nThe goal is to transform the sequence into an arithmetic progression.

The differences are:\n\\[\n6, 10, 12, 12, 10, 6, 0, -8, -18, -30.\n\\]\nWe can pair the terms to perform the morphs.

If \\(H = 1\\), then \\(H > O\\) if \\(O = 0\\). So, \\(P(H > O \\mid H = 1) = P(O = 0) = \\frac{1}{32}\\).\n3. If \\(H = 2\\), then \\(H > O\\) if \\(O = 0\\) or \\(O = 1\\).
