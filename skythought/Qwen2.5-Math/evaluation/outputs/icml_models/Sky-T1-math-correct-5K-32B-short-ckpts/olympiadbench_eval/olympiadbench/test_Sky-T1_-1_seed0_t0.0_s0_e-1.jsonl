If $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ are pairwise distinct points in the open unit interval $(0,1)$, then some $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$.\n\n\n\nLemma 2.

If this were the case, notice that necessarily $k>1$; also, $x_{1}-x_{0}<x_{2}-x_{0} \\leq\\left(\\left\\lfloor m_{1} / 2\\right\\rfloor+1\\right) \\mu_{0}$ and $x_{k+1}-x_{k}<$ $x_{k+1}-x_{k-1} \\leq\\left(\\left\\lfloor m_{k} / 2\\right\\rfloor+1\\right) \\mu_{0}$.

Suppose, if possible, that no $t_{i}$ is isolated from the other $t_{j}$ by an open subinterval of $(0,1)$ whose length is greater than or equal to $\\lambda$. Without loss of generality, we may (and will) assume that $0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{k}<t_{k+1}=1$. Since the open interval $\\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}\\right)$ isolates $t_{i}$ from the other $t_{j}$, its length, $t_{i+1}-t_{i-1}$, is less than $\\lambda$. Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$"], "answer_type": "Expression", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["1. **Initial Setup and Definitions**:\n   - Let $n$ be a positive integer.\n   - Consider a configuration $C$ consisting of $4n$ points within an open unit square $U$.\n   - We aim to find the largest real number $\\mu$ such that for any configuration $C$, there exists an open rectangle $R$ within $U$ with sides parallel to $U$, containing exactly one point of $C$, and having an area greater than or equal to $\\mu$.\n\n2. **Upper Bound for $\\mu$**:\n   - We first show that $\\mu \\leq \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n   - Divide the unit square $U$ into $4n$ smaller squares, each of side length $\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}$.\n   - Place one point of $C$ in each of these smaller squares.\n   - Any open rectangle $R$ containing exactly one point of $C$ must lie entirely within one of these smaller squares.\n   - The area of each smaller square is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n   - Therefore, the area of $R$ is strictly less than $\\frac{1}{4n}$.\n   - Hence, $\\mu \\leq \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n\n3. **Lower Bound for $\\mu$**:\n   - We now show that $\\mu \\geq \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n   - Assume, for contradiction, that for some configuration $C$, every open rectangle $R$ with area $\\frac{1}{4n}$ contains either no points or at least two points of $C$.\n   - Consider a horizontal line $\\ell$ that does not pass through any points of $C$.\n   - Move $\\ell$ upwards from the bottom of $U$ until it first touches a point $P$ of $C$.\n   - Let $h$ be the height from the bottom of $U$ to $\\ell$.\n   - Divide the portion of $U$ below $\\ell$ into two equal horizontal strips $U_1$ and $U_2$.\n   - By the pigeonhole principle, one of these strips, say $U_1$, contains at least $n$ points of $C$.\n   - Divide $U_1$ into $n$ equal-width vertical strips $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_n$.\n   - By the assumption, each $V_i$ must contain at least two points of $C$ to avoid having an open rectangle of area $\\frac{1}{4n}$ containing exactly one point.\n   - Consider the leftmost point $Q$ in the topmost row of points in $U_1$.\n   - The rectangle formed by $Q$ and the left and right boundaries of its vertical strip $V_i$, and a horizontal line just below $Q$, has an area of $\\frac{1}{2n} \\times h$.\n   - Since $h < \\frac{1}{2}$ (as $\\ell$ does not reach the midpoint of $U$), the area of this rectangle is less than $\\frac{1}{4n}$, contradicting our assumption.\n   - Therefore, there must exist an open rectangle of area at least $\\frac{1}{4n}$ containing exactly one point of $C$.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Combining the upper and lower bounds, we conclude that $\\mu = \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4n}}\n\\]"], "pred": ["\\frac{1}{4n}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight.

Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$.

But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal.

First, we note a key property:\n\n\n\nClaim (Sign of $f$ ). $f$ attains wither only nonnegative values, or only nonpositive values.\n\n\n\nProof. This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.\n\n\n\nIf the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length $m-1$ at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board. Colour the cells of the board chess-like and notice that in each of the two triangular regions the number of black cells and the number of white cells differ by $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty.

Hence, the sum of the two smallest areas of border triangles tends to $\\frac{1}{4}$, as well as $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}\\right]$; therefore, their ratio tends to 1 , and $k \\geq 1$.\n\nWe are left to prove that $k=1$ satisfies the desired property.\n\n<img_3730>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3171>\n\nFigure 2\n\n<img_4006>\n\nFigure 3\n\nLemma. Let points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ lie respectively on sides $B C, C A, A B$ of a triangle $A B C$. Then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\geq \\min \\left\\{\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right],\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right],\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. Let $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ be the midpoints of sides $B C, C A$ and $A B$, respectively.\n\nSuppose that two of points $A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}$ lie in one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ (for convenience, let points $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ lie in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$; see Figure 2). Let segments $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A A_{1}$ intersect at point $X$. Then $X$ also lies in triangle $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$. Hence $A_{1} X \\geq A X$, and we have\n$$\n\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} A_{1} X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A_{1} X C_{1}}{\\frac{1}{2} A X \\cdot B_{1} C_{1} \\cdot \\sin \\angle A X B_{1}}=\\frac{A_{1} X}{A X} \\geq 1\n$$\nas required.\n\nOtherwise, each one of triangles $A C^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}, B A^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}, C B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$ contains exactly one of points $A_{1}$, $B_{1}, C_{1}$, and we can assume that $B A_{1}<B A^{\\prime}, C B_{1}<C B^{\\prime}, A C_{1}<A C^{\\prime}$ (see Figure 3). Then lines $B_{1} A_{1}$ and $A B$ intersect at a point $Y$ on the extension of $A B$ beyond point $B$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{C_{1} Y}{C^{\\prime} Y}>1$; also, lines $A_{1} C^{\\prime}$ and $C A$ intersect at a point $Z$ on the extension of $C A$ beyond point $A$, hence $\\frac{\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]}{\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]}=\\frac{B_{1} Z}{B^{\\prime} Z}>1$. Finally, since $A_{1} A^{\\prime} \\| B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$, we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C^{\\prime}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]=\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$.\n\n\n\nNow, from $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[A C_{1} B_{1}\\right]+\\left[B A_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C B_{1} A_{1}\\right]=[A B C]$ we obtain that one of the remaining triangles $A C_{1} B_{1}, B A_{1} C_{1}, C B_{1} A_{1}$ has an area less than $\\frac{1}{4}[A B C]$, so it is less than $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$.\n\nNow we return to the problem. We say that triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small if $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is less than each of $\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$; otherwise this triangle is big (the similar notion is introduced for triangles $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}, C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}, D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ ). If both triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}$ are big, then $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of some border triangle, and $\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ is not less than the area of another one; hence, $S_{1}=\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]+\\left[C_{1} D_{1} A_{1}\\right] \\geq S$. The same is valid for the pair of $B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$. So it is sufficient to prove that in one of these pairs both triangles are big.\n\nSuppose the contrary. Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small. We can assume also that $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq$ $\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]$. Note that in this case ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$.\n\nConsider two cases.\n\n<img_3464>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3580>\n\nFigure 5\n\nCase 1. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ intersects line $A B$ at some point $K$. Let ray $D_{1} C_{1}$ intersect line $B C$ at point $L$ (see Figure 4). Then we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right],\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ (both - since $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ is small), and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right] \\leq\\left[D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[A A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} D_{1}\\right]<\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]$ (since triangle $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ is small). This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a \"sufficiently far\" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$. Then analogously we have $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[C C_{1} B_{1}\\right]<\\left[L C_{1} B_{1}\\right]$ and $\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]<\\left[B B_{1} A_{1}\\right]$ since triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is small.

Consider an arbitrary prime $p$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists some $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $p \\mid f(x)$. Let\n$$\nd=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: p \\mid f(x)\\}\n$$\nBy induction on $k$, we obtain that $p \\mid f(k d)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The base is true since $p \\mid f(d)$.

Let\n$$\ny=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: d \\nmid x, p \\mid f(x)\\} .\n$$\nBy the choice of $d$, we have $y>d$, and $y-d$ is a positive integer not divisible by $d$. Then $p \\nmid f(y-d)$, while $p \\mid f(d)$ and $p \\mid f(d+(y-d))=f(y)$. This contradicts the problem condition. Hence, there is no such $x$, and\n$$\np|f(x) \\Longleftrightarrow d| x .\\tag{1}\n$$\nTake arbitrary $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x \\equiv y(\\bmod d)$. We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Using (1) we get $0 \\equiv y+(2 x d-x) \\equiv y-x$ $(\\bmod d)$.\n\nThus, we have proved that\n$$\nx \\equiv y \\quad(\\bmod d) \\Longleftrightarrow f(x) \\equiv f(y) \\quad(\\bmod p)\\tag{2}\n$$\nWe are left to show that $p=d$ : in this case (1) and (2) provide the desired statements.\n\nThe numbers $1,2, \\ldots, d$ have distinct residues modulo $d$.

By (2), all these $x_{i}$ 's have distinct residues modulo $d$. For the same reasons, $d \\geq p$. Hence, $d=p$.\n\nNow we prove that $f(n)=n$ by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$. Note that there exists a prime $q \\mid n$, so by the Lemma $q \\mid k$ and $k>1$.\n\nIf $k>n$ then $k-n+1>1$, and there exists a prime $p \\mid k-n+1$; we have $k \\equiv n-1$ $(\\bmod p)$.

These are called \"ghost ants.\"\n- The path of a real ant can be thought of as the path of a ghost ant that has been deflected by other ghost ants.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculating the maximum time for an ant to fall off\n- The maximum distance an ant can travel before falling off the board is the distance from the center of the board to one of the corners.\n- The center of the board is at $(\\frac{m}{2}, \\frac{m}{2})$.\n- The distance from the center to a corner (e.g., $(0,0)$) is $\\sqrt{(\\frac{m}{2})^2 + (\\frac{m}{2})^2} = \\frac{m\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n- Since the ants move at a speed of 1 unit per second, the maximum time for an ant to fall off is $\\frac{m\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ seconds.\n\n#### Step 5: Considering the discrete nature of the problem\n- Since the ants move in discrete steps of 1 unit per second, we need to consider the integer part of the maximum time.\n- The maximum integer time before an ant falls off is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right\\rfloor$.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\n- The latest possible moment at which the last ant falls off the checkerboard is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right\\rfloor$ seconds.\n- This time is achievable by placing an ant at the center of the board and having it move towards a corner.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right\\rfloor}$ seconds."], "pred": ["\\lfloor\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\rfloor"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

In each cell we write the number of napkins covering it, and we record the maximal number $k$ of cells that all contain the same nonzero number. Considering all possible napkin configurations, what is the largest value of $k$ ?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3986729", "unit": null, "solution": ["Let $m=39$, then $2011=52 m-17$. We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.", "We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$.

For example, placing one napkin and then placing another napkin such that it overlaps with the first napkin in a $51 \\times 51$ area. This way, the overlapping area will have cells covered by two napkins.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculating the number of cells covered by two napkins\nThe overlapping area of two $52 \\times 52$ napkins, when placed such that they overlap in a $51 \\times 51$ area, will have $51 \\times 51 = 2601$ cells covered by two napkins.\n\n#### Step 5: Verifying if higher $k$ is possible\nWe need to check if it is possible to have more than $2601$ cells covered by the same number of napkins.

The total number of flags is $5 \\leq r \\ell$, hence one of the factors (say, $r$ ) should be at least 3 . On the other hand, $\\ell, r \\leq 4$, so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be $L_{1} R_{1}$ and $L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, since $r \\geq 3$, there exist some flags $L_{3} R_{3}$ and $L_{4} R_{4}$ such that $R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}$ are distinct.

By (i), one of the pairs $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(L^{\\prime}, L_{2}\\right)$ can form a $2 \\times 2$ square with monochrome diagonal; we can assume that $L^{\\prime}, L_{2}$ form a square with a blue diagonal. Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$. For the induction step, assume that $N>4$, consider any $2^{N-2}+1$ flags of length $N$, and arrange them into a large flag of size $\\left(2^{N-2}+1\\right) \\times N$.

We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags.

Next, let the edge $(c, f)$ appear in $E_{\\mathrm{y}}$ if the intersection of column $c$ and flag $f$ is yellow, and $(c, f) \\in E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ otherwise. Then we have to prove exactly that one of the graphs $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$ contains a matching with all the vertices of $V$ involved.\n\nAssume that these matchings do not exist.

Our aim is to prove that this is impossible. Note that $S_{\\mathrm{y}}, S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq V$ since $N \\leq 2^{N-2}+1$.\n\nFirst, suppose that $S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}} \\neq \\varnothing$, so there exists some $c \\in S_{\\mathrm{y}} \\cap S_{\\mathrm{b}}$. Note that each flag is connected to $c$ either in $G_{\\mathrm{y}}$ or in $G_{\\mathrm{b}}$, hence $E_{\\mathrm{y}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{y}}\\right) \\cup E_{\\mathrm{b}}\\left(S_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)=V^{\\prime}$.

The upper-left block is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe system of blocks has the following properties..\n\n$\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ If $(i, j)$ is a B-block then $(i+1, j)$ is a B-block: otherwise the kings in these two blocks can take each other. Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns. So we have a unique arrangement of blocks that leads to the arrangement of kings satisfying the condition of the problem (see Fig. 3).\n\n<img_4043>\n\nFig. 3\n\n<img_3321>\n\nFig. 4\n\nCase 2. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column. Repeating the arguments from Case 1, we obtain that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are L-rows (and all other rows are R-rows), the columns from the 1st to the 25th are B-columns (and all other columns are T-columns), so we find exactly one more arrangement of kings (see Fig. 4)."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to place 2500 chess kings on a \\(100 \\times 100\\) chessboard such that:\n   - No two kings can capture each other (i.e., no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common vertex).\n   - Each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n2. **Initial Consideration:**\n   Given that each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings, we start by considering how to place these kings in a way that satisfies the non-attacking condition.\n\n3. **Placing Kings in Rows:**\n   To ensure that no two kings in the same row can attack each other, we must place them such that no two kings are adjacent either horizontally or diagonally. One way to achieve this is by placing the kings in a staggered pattern within each row.\n\n4. **Pattern for Placing Kings:**\n   We can place the kings in a row such that they occupy every fourth square. For example, in the first row, we place kings in columns 1, 5, 9, ..., 97. This ensures that no two kings are adjacent or share a common vertex.\n\n5. **Extending the Pattern to All Rows:**\n   To extend this pattern to all rows while ensuring that each column also contains exactly 25 kings, we can shift the starting position of the pattern by one column for each subsequent row. This creates a diagonal-like pattern across the board.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **No Two Kings Attack Each Other:** By placing kings every fourth square in a row and shifting the starting position by one column for each row, we ensure that no two kings are in squares that share a common vertex.\n   - **Each Row and Column Contains Exactly 25 Kings:** Since we are placing kings in a staggered pattern that covers every fourth square and shifting this pattern by one column for each row, each row and each column will indeed contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n7. **Counting the Number of Arrangements:**\n   The specific pattern described (placing kings every fourth square and shifting the starting position by one column for each row) is the only way to satisfy both conditions given the constraints of the problem. Any deviation from this pattern would either result in two kings being able to attack each other or an unequal distribution of kings in rows or columns.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   There is exactly one way to arrange the kings on the board that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\n\nLemma. Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles.

This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between $A$ and $B$ and also between $B$ and $C$. We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side.

Finally, we require that, for every non-empty set in any group, the same set must appear in the other 2 groups. What is the maximum number of colors present with these new requirements?\n\nLet us call strange a big $n \\times n \\times n$ cube whose painting scheme satisfies the new requirements, and let $D$ be the number of colors in a strange cube.

The sets of colors in all the groups for $B$ are the same as the sets for $A$, removing exactly the colors in $\\mathcal{S}$, and no others! Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for $B$ still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in $B$ only matched $X, Y$ or $Z$ before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, $B$ is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that $B$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}$ colors.

On the other hand, the set $\\mathcal{F}$ of all butterflies in the end of the process is stable. This means that $\\mathcal{F}$ is the largest (with respect to inclusion) stable set within $\\mathcal{Q}$, and we are about to describe this set.\n\n2. A description of a final set. The following notion will be useful.

Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope. Let $A_{i}$ be the farthest from $O$ lattice point in $r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}$, set $k_{i}=\\left|r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\right|$, let $\\vec{v}_{i}=\\overrightarrow{O A_{i}}$, and finally denote $\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{\\vec{v}_{i}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant m\\right\\}$; see the Figure above to the right. We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$.

Luciano keeps drawing tangent segments until no more can be drawn. Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "6048", "unit": null, "solution": ["First, consider a particular arrangement of circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ where all the centers are aligned and each $C_{i}$ is eclipsed from the other circles by its neighbors - for example, taking $C_{i}$ with center $\\left(i^{2}, 0\\right)$ and radius $i / 2$ works. Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.", "First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Geometry", "code": ["1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have 2017 circles on a blackboard, none of which are tangent to each other, and no three circles share a common tangent.\n   - A tangent segment is defined as a line segment that is a common tangent to two circles, starting at one tangent point and ending at the other.\n   - Luciano draws these tangent segments such that no segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn segments.\n   - We need to find the possible number of tangent segments Luciano can draw.\n\n2. **Initial Consideration:**\n   - Each pair of circles can have at most 4 common tangents (2 direct and 2 transverse).\n   - However, due to the constraints (no intersections with other circles or segments), the number of drawable tangents is limited.\n\n3. **Key Insight:**\n   - The problem can be approached by considering the circles as vertices of a graph and the tangent segments as edges.\n   - The condition that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn segments implies that the graph formed is planar.\n\n4. **Planar Graph Theory Application:**\n   - In a planar graph with \\( n \\) vertices (circles), the maximum number of edges (tangent segments) is given by \\( 3n - 6 \\) for \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\n   - For \\( n = 2017 \\), the maximum number of edges is \\( 3 \\times 2017 - 6 = 6045 \\).\n\n5. **Verification of Feasibility:**\n   - We need to ensure that for any number of tangent segments \\( k \\) where \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq 6045 \\), it is possible to arrange the circles and draw the segments accordingly.\n   - By carefully arranging the circles in a way that they form a convex hull and drawing the tangents in a non-intersecting manner, it is feasible to achieve any number of tangent segments within this range.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The possible number of tangent segments Luciano can draw, without any intersections, ranges from 0 to \\( 6045 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 6045}\n\\]"], "pred": ["0,1,2,\\ldots,6045"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

However, we must ensure that after cancellation, the equation still holds and has no real roots. Let's denote the simplified equation after removing some factors as:\n   \\[\n   P(x) = Q(x)\n   \\]\n   where \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) are products of the remaining factors.\n\n3. **Condition for No Real Roots**:\n   For the equation \\( P(x) = Q(x) \\) to have no real roots, the polynomial \\( P(x) - Q(x) \\) must not intersect the x-axis. This implies that \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) should not have any common real roots and their graphs should not cross.\n\n4. **Choosing Factors to Remove**:\n   To achieve the condition of no real roots, we can strategically remove factors. Consider removing factors in such a way that the remaining polynomials \\( P(x) \\) and \\( Q(x) \\) are non-overlapping in their roots. For instance, we can split the factors into two sets and remove the overlapping ones.\n\n5. **Example of Factor Removal**:\n   Suppose we remove all factors from one side for \\( x = 1, 2, \\ldots, 1008 \\) and from the other side for \\( x = 1009, 1010, \\ldots, 2016 \\).

By symmetry, $y^3, z^3 \\in \\mathcal{B}$ as well.\n\n3. **Generalizing for Higher Powers:**\n   - For any $n \\geq 3$, we can express $x^n$ as:\n     \\[\n     x^n = x^{n-3} \\cdot x^3 = x^{n-3} \\left[(x+y+z)x^2 + (xy + yz + zx)(-x) + xyz(1)\\right]\n     \\]\n     This shows that $x^n \\in \\mathcal{B}$ for $n \\geq 3$. By symmetry, $y^n, z^n \\in \\mathcal{B}$ for $n \\geq 3$.\n\n4. **Combining Different Powers:**\n   - Consider the product $x^i y^j$ where $i, j \\geq 1$. We can write:\n     \\[\n     x^i y^j = (x+y+z)(x^{i-1}y^{j-1}xy) + (xy + yz + zx)(-x^{i-1}y^{j-1}z) + xyz(x^{i-1}y^{j-1})\n     \\]\n     This shows that $x^i y^j \\in \\mathcal{B}$ for $i, j \\geq 1$. By symmetry, any product of the form $x^i y^j z^k$ where at least two of $i, j, k$ are non-zero and their sum is at least 3, belongs to $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the above steps, we see that any monomial $x^i y^j z^k$ where $i+j+k \\geq 4$ can be expressed in the required form and hence belongs to $\\mathcal{B}$.\n   - Therefore, the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that $x^i y^j z^k \\in \\mathcal{B}$ for all $i, j, k$ satisfying $i+j+k \\geq n$ is $n = 4$.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$.

An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good.

The machine is initially positioned at the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin, where there are $k$ heads (and the position before the first coin is considered to be the $0^{\\text {th }}$ coin). The machine then moves according to the following rules, stopping when it reaches the position before the first coin: if the coin at its current position is $H$, it flips the coin and moves to the previous coin, while if the coin at its current position is $T$, it flips the coin and moves to the next position.\n\nConsider the maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction. Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin. Similarly, $a$ consecutive moves to the previous coin are followed by at least $a+1$ consecutive moves to\n\n\n\nthe next coin. There cannot be more than $n$ consecutive moves in the same direction, so this proves that the process terminates (with a move from the first coin to the position before the first coin).\n\nThus we have a (possibly empty) sequence $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{t} \\leqslant n$ giving the lengths of maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction, where the final $a_{t}$ moves must be moves to the previous coin, ending before the first coin.

This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)", "We explicitly describe what happens with an arbitrary sequence $C$ of $n$ coins.

The following observation is also useful to simplify the analysis of strategies for Bob.\n\nObservation A. Consider two consecutive rounds. Suppose that in the first round Bob made a $k$-move and Alice picked the left group, and then in the second round Bob makes an $\\ell$-move, with $\\ell>k$. We may then assume, without loss of generality, that Alice again picks the left group.\n\nProof. Suppose Alice picks the right group in the second round. Then the combined effect of the two rounds is that each of the boxes $B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{\\ell}$ lost two pebbles (and the other boxes are unchanged). Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\nFor Alice. Alice initially distributes pebbles according to $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$. Suppose the current configuration of pebbles dominates $V_{i}$. If Bob makes a $k$-move with $k \\geqslant i$ then Alice picks the left group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i+1}$. Likewise, if Bob makes a $k$-move with $k<i$ then Alice picks the right group, which results in a configuration that dominates $V_{i-1}$. Since none of $V_{1}, \\ldots, V_{N}$ contains an empty box, Alice can prevent Bob from ever winning.\n\nFor Bob. The key idea in this solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim. If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group. After Bob's $(2 k-1)$-move, the rightmost box becomes empty and Bob wins.\n\nNow, we claim that if $n<M$ then either there already exists an empty box, or there exist a positive integer $k$ and $2 k$ boxes with at most $k$ pebbles each (and thus Bob can force a win). Otherwise, assume each box contains at least 1 pebble, and for each $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, at least $N-(2 k-1)=N+1-2 k$ boxes contain at least $k+1$ pebbles. Summing, there are at least as many pebbles in total as in $V_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil}$; that is, at least $M$ pebbles, as desired.", "We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer.

Hence this configuration is strictly dominated by that before the first round, and it suffices to consider only Alice's other response.\n\n\nFor Alice. Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. Alice starts with the boxes in the configuration $V_{K}$. For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times. This means that the number of pebbles in a box could decrease by at most the number of choices for which Alice would have started by removing a pebble from the group containing that box. These numbers are, for each box,\n\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rfloor,\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rfloor, \\ldots, 1,0,1, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}-1\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nThese are pointwise less than the numbers of pebbles the boxes started with, meaning that no box ever becomes empty with this strategy.\n\nSo the final answer is $n=960$. In general, if there are $N>1$ boxes, the answer is $n=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$.\n\nCommon remarks. We present solutions for the general case of $N>1$ boxes, and write $M=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rceil-1$ for the claimed answer. For $1 \\leqslant k<N$, say that Bob makes a $k$-move if he splits the boxes into a left group $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{k}\\right\\}$ and a right group $\\left\\{B_{k+1}, \\ldots, B_{N}\\right\\}$. Say that one configuration dominates another if it has at least as many pebbles in each box, and say that it strictly dominates the other configuration if it also has more pebbles in at least one box.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

For a finite nonempty set $B$ of positive integers, denote by $\\operatorname{lcm} B$ and $\\operatorname{gcd} B$ the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor of the elements in $B$, respectively.\n\nConsider any good partition $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}\\right)$ of $A$. By definition, $\\operatorname{lcm} A_{1}=d=\\operatorname{gcd} A_{2}$ for some positive integer $d$. For any $a_{i} \\in A_{1}$ and $a_{j} \\in A_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leqslant d \\leqslant a_{j}$. Therefore, we have $A_{1}=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$ and $A_{2}=\\left\\{a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ for some $k$ with $1 \\leqslant k<n$. Hence, each good partition is determined by an element $a_{k}$, where $1 \\leqslant k<n$. We call such $a_{k}$ partitioning.\n\nIt is convenient now to define $\\ell_{k}=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right)$ and $g_{k}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ for $1 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-1$. So $a_{k}$ is partitioning exactly when $\\ell_{k}=g_{k}$.\n\nWe proceed by proving some properties of partitioning elements, using the following claim. Claim. If $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k}$ are partitioning where $2 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-1$, then $g_{k-1}=g_{k}=a_{k}$.\n\nProof. Assume that $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k}$ are partitioning. Since $\\ell_{k-1}=g_{k-1}$, we have $\\ell_{k-1} \\mid a_{k}$. Therefore, $g_{k}=\\ell_{k}=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(\\ell_{k-1}, a_{k}\\right)=a_{k}$, and $g_{k-1}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{k}, g_{k}\\right)=a_{k}$, as desired.\n\nProperty 1. For every $k=2,3, \\ldots, n-2$, at least one of $a_{k-1}, a_{k}$, and $a_{k+1}$ is not partitioning. Proof. Suppose, to the contrary, that all three numbers $a_{k-1}, a_{k}$, and $a_{k+1}$ are partitioning. The claim yields that $a_{k+1}=g_{k}=a_{k}$, a contradiction.\n\nProperty 2. The elements $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ cannot be simultaneously partitioning. Also, $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ cannot be simultaneously partitioning\n\nProof. Assume that $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are partitioning. By the claim, it follows that $a_{2}=g_{1}=\\ell_{1}=$ $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(a_{1}\\right)=a_{1}$, a contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, assume that $a_{n-2}$ and $a_{n-1}$ are partitioning. The claim yields that $a_{n-1}=g_{n-1}=$ $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}\\right)=a_{n}$, a contradiction.\n\nNow let $A$ be an $n$-element set with exactly 2015 good partitions. Clearly, we have $n \\geqslant 5$. Using Property 2, we find that there is at most one partitioning element in each of $\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$.

Therefore, there are at most $(n-1)-2-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-5}{3}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lceil\\frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\right\\rceil$ partitioning elements in $A$. Thus, $\\left\\lceil\\frac{2(n-2)}{3}\\right\\rceil \\geqslant 2015$, which implies that $n \\geqslant 3024$.\n\nFinally, we show that there exists a set of 3024 positive integers with exactly 2015 partitioning elements.

Now let $(a, b, c)$ be any triple with the desired property. If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct.\n\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n$$\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWe are to prove that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,6,11)$ or $(3,5,7)$.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$. Now (2) implies\n\n$$\n9 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{\\beta}\\left(2^{\\beta+1}+5\\right)-16,\n$$\n\nand by $\\beta \\geqslant 5$ the right-hand side is not divisible by 32 . Thus $\\alpha \\leqslant 4$ and we get a contradiction to (5).\n\n\n\nCase 2.2. $a \\geqslant 3$.\n\nPick an integer $\\vartheta \\in\\{-1,+1\\}$ such that $c-\\vartheta$ is not divisible by 4 . Now\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}+\\vartheta \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=\\left(b c-a \\vartheta^{2}\\right)+\\vartheta(c a-b)=(b+a \\vartheta)(c-\\vartheta)\n$$\n\nis divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and, consequently, $b+a \\vartheta$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta-1}$. On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.", "As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$.\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other $\\overline{\\text { words, }} L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$.\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$. But then\n\n$$\n\\mho(f(x)-f(y)) \\geqslant \\mho\\left(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\right)>\\mho(\\ell)=\\mho(x-y),\n$$\n\nwhich is impossible.\n\nNow we complete the induction step. By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\not \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement.\n\n\n\nClaim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer $a$ such that $f(t)=a t$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$.

To see that each negative real number $-C$ can be $P(0)$, it suffices to check that for every $C>0$ the polynomial $P(x)=-\\left(\\frac{2 x^{2}}{C}+C\\right)$ has the property described in the statement of the problem. Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$. In fact we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|=y^{2}+\\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant \\frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nwhere in the first estimate equality can only hold if $|x|=C$, whilst in the second one it can only hold if $x=0$. As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II. Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$.

We write both $A$ and $B$ in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and say that $A$ beats $B$ if and only if $a_{k}>b_{k}$. This rule clearly satisfies all three conditions, and the rules corresponding to different $k$ are all different. Thus there are at least $n$ different rules.\n\nPart II. Now we have to prove that there is no other way to define such a rule. Suppose that our rule satisfies the conditions, and let $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ be minimal with the property that\n\n$$\nA_{k}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, k, n+k+1, n+k+2, \\ldots, 2 n\\} \\prec B_{k}=\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n+k\\} .\n$$\n\nClearly, such a $k$ exists, since this holds for $k=n$ by assumption. Now consider two disjoint sets $X=\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\}$ and $Y=\\left\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right\\}$, both in increasing order (i.e., $x_{1}<x_{2}<\\cdots<x_{n}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}<\\cdots<y_{n}$ ). We claim that $X<Y$ if (and only if - this follows automatically) $x_{k}<y_{k}$.\n\nTo prove this statement, pick arbitrary real numbers $u_{i}, v_{i}, w_{i} \\notin X \\cup Y$ such that\n\n$$\nu_{1}<u_{2}<\\cdots<u_{k-1}<\\min \\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right), \\quad \\max \\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\\right)<v_{k+1}<v_{k+2}<\\cdots<v_{n},\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx_{k}<v_{1}<v_{2}<\\cdots<v_{k}<w_{1}<w_{2}<\\cdots<w_{n}<u_{k}<u_{k+1}<\\cdots<u_{n}<y_{k},\n$$\n\nand set\n\n$$\nU=\\left\\{u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{n}\\right\\}, V=\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right\\}, W=\\left\\{w_{1}, w_{2}, \\ldots, w_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n- $u_{i}<y_{i}$ and $x_{i}<v_{i}$ for all $i$, so $U<Y$ and $X<V$ by the second condition.\n\n\n\n- The elements of $U \\cup W$ are ordered in the same way as those of $A_{k-1} \\cup B_{k-1}$, and since $A_{k-1}>B_{k-1}$ by our choice of $k$, we also have $U>W$ (if $k=1$, this is trivial).\n- The elements of $V \\cup W$ are ordered in the same way as those of $A_{k} \\cup B_{k}$, and since $A_{k} \\prec B_{k}$ by our choice of $k$, we also have $V<W$.\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\nX<V<W<U<Y\n$$\n\nso $X<Y$ by the third condition, which is what we wanted to prove.", "Another possible approach to Part II of this problem is induction on $n$. For $n=1$, there is trivially only one rule in view of the second condition.\n\nIn the following, we assume that our claim (namely, that there are no possible rules other than those given in Part I) holds for $n-1$ in place of $n$. We start with the following observation: Claim. At least one of the two relations\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\n$$\n\nholds.\n\nProof. Suppose that the first relation does not hold. Since our rule may only depend on the relative order, we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\}) .\n$$\n\nLikewise, if the second relation does not hold, then we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}) .\n$$\n\nNow condition 3 implies that\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}),\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the second condition.\n\nNow we distinguish two cases, depending on which of the two relations actually holds:\n\nFirst case: $(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})$.\n\nLet $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ be two disjoint sets, both in increasing order. We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$. Set $-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}$ for any $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$.

The sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) will each contain 100 of these positions.\n\n3. **Defining the Rule:**\n   We need to define a rule that decides the winner based on the positions of the cards.

Specifically, if \\( A \\) has at least \\( k \\) positions among the largest 100 positions, then \\( A \\) wins.\n\n4. **Verifying the Conditions:**\n   - **Condition 1:** The rule depends only on the relative order of the cards, which is satisfied by our definition using positions.\n   - **Condition 2:** If \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) has the 100 largest positions, so \\( A \\) wins if \\( k \\leq 100 \\).\n   - **Condition 3:** This condition requires transitivity.

Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$.

The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Consider $x<y$. It holds that $y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y) \\leqslant 2$. Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2.

Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing.

In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew.

Since she can now produce $\\mathbf{e}(1), \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}(n)$ and already had $\\mathbf{c}$, she can (as we argued earlier) produce any integer-valued tuple.\n\n\n\n**Two tuples do not suffice.** We start with an observation: Let $a$ be a non-negative real number and suppose that two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ satisfy $\\mathbf{v}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{v}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{w}_{j} \\geqslant a \\mathbf{w}_{k}$ for some $1 \\leqslant j, k \\leqslant n$.

Since $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{v}_{k}$ or $\\mathbf{m}_{k}=\\mathbf{w}_{k}$, the observation follows.\n\nAs a consequence of this observation we have that if all starting tuples satisfy such an inequality, then all generated tuples will also satisfy it, and so we would not be able to obtain every integer-valued tuple.\n\nLet us now prove that Lucy needs at least three starting tuples. For contradiction, let us suppose that Lucy started with only two tuples $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$. We are going to distinguish two cases. In the first case, suppose we can find a coordinate $i$ such that $\\mathbf{v}_{i}, \\mathbf{w}_{i} \\geqslant 0$. Both operations preserve the sign, thus we can not generate any tuple that has negative $i$-th coordinate.

Other fields will be called non-wells.

We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino.

Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields $(2,6 k+s)$ and $(1,6 k+s+3)$. For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$.

If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$.

The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points.

Otherwise, let $2 \\leqslant q \\leqslant 2017$ be the minimal index with $a_{q}<1$. We have $S(q, i)=i$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, q-1$, while $S(q, q)=q-1$. Therefore, $a_{q}<1$ yields $a_{q}=S(q, q) / q=1-\\frac{1}{q}$.\n\nNow we have $S(q+1, i)=i-\\frac{1}{q}$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, q$, and $S(q+1, q+1)=q-\\frac{1}{q}$.

By Claim 2, we have $\\left[m_{k}, M_{k}\\right] \\subseteq\\left[m_{k-1}, M_{k-1}\\right] \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq\\left[m_{n}, M_{n}\\right]$.

We use induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is routine. To perform the induction step, we need to prove the inequalities\n\n$$\n\\frac{S(n, n)}{n} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{S(n, k)}{k} \\leqslant \\frac{S(n, n-1)}{n-1}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor every positive integer $k \\leqslant n$. Clearly, these inequalities hold for $k=n$ and $k=n-1$, as $S(n, n)=S(n, n-1)>0$. In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$.

Since any line contains at most two points of the circle, one needs at least 4026/2 $=2013$ lines.\n\nIt remains to prove that one can reach the goal using 2013 lines.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "996000", "unit": null, "solution": ["First we show that this number is an upper bound for the number of cells a limp rook can visit. To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside. Thus the path between these two points must cross the previous path.\n\nBut an intersection is only possible if a cell is visited twice.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$.

Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd.

She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box.\n\nPlayer $A$ 's goal is to ensure at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how $B$ plays and how many moves are made.

For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response.

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$. Since $y+z=503 k=503 \\cdot 2$, this leads to $5 y z=503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$. However $503^{2} \\cdot 2^{2}-4$ is not a multiple of 5 .

However then $y=z=1$, which is false in view of $y+z \\geq 503$. Therefore $k=1$ and (2) takes the form $(y-z)^{2}=1$, yielding $z-y=|y-z|=1$. Combined with $k=1$ and $y+z=503 k$, this leads to $y=251, z=252$.\n\nIn summary the triple $(2,251,252)$ is the only solution."], "answer_type": "Tuple", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["1. **Given Equation and Initial Simplification:**\n\n   We start with the given equation:\n   \\[\n   x^{3}\\left(y^{3}+z^{3}\\right) = 2012(x y z + 2)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x, y, z\\) are positive integers and \\(x \\leq y \\leq z\\), we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\(xyz\\):\n   \\[\n   x^{2}\\left(\\frac{y^{3}+z^{3}}{yz}\\right) = 2012\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{xyz}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x^{2}\\left(\\frac{y^{3}+z^{3}}{yz}\\right) = 2012 + \\frac{4024}{xyz}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Analyzing the Divisibility by 1006:**\n\n   Notice that the right-hand side of the equation must be an integer, implying that \\(xyz\\) must divide 4024.

Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.", "We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions.

For each row, we need to ensure that the string formed by that row is in $\\mathcal{D}$, and also that the strings formed by the columns up to that point are in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n#### Step 3: Ensuring Column Strings are in $\\mathcal{D}$\nFor each row $i$ (where $1 \\leq i \\leq k$), we need to ensure that the strings formed by the first $i$ rows in each column are in $\\mathcal{D}$. This means we need at least $2^{k-i+1}$ different strings in $\\mathcal{D}$ to cover all possible combinations of the first $i$ rows for each column.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculating the Minimum Size $m$\nThe minimum size $m$ of $\\mathcal{D}$ must be such that it can accommodate the maximum number of required strings at any step of the construction. The maximum number of strings required at any step is when $i = 1$, which is $2^k$. However, we need to ensure that for each $i$, there are enough strings to cover the combinations of the first $i$ rows. The sum of these requirements is:\n\\[ m \\geq \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{k-i+1} = 2^k + 2^{k-1} + \\cdots + 2^1 = 2^{k+1} - 2 \\]\n\n#### Step 5: Verifying the Bound\nWe need to verify that $m = 2^k + 1$ is sufficient. If $\\mathcal{D}$ contains $2^k + 1$ strings, then by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one string that can be used to start the grid. For each subsequent row, we can always find a string that maintains the condition for the columns, as there are enough strings to cover the required combinations.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in the manner described is $m = 2^k + 1$.\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\boxed{2^k + 1}$."], "pred": ["2^k+1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 ."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Number Theory", "code": ["We are given that $f(n)$ is the number of positive integers with exactly $n$ digits whose digits sum to 5.

Specifically, this occurs when $n+4$ in base-5 has digits that are either all 0 or 1, and the number of 1's is exactly 4 (since $\\binom{1}{1} = 1$ and $\\binom{0}{0} = 1$).\n\n#### Step 4: Counting valid $n$\nWe need to count how many numbers $n$ from 1 to 2014 satisfy this condition.

This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$.

Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m-3}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nTherefore, $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$.\n\nSince $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$ and $T(2 m-3) \\leq T(2 m)$, then $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$.\n\n\nNext, we prove (F2):\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{k}$ and a corresponding triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$.

Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$.

This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$. Next, we note that if we can find an odd positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010 \\geq$ $T(n-2)$, then we will have found the desired value of $n$ :\n\nThis is because $n$ and $n-2$ are both odd, and by property (F2), any smaller odd positive integer $k$ will give $T(k) \\leq T(n-2) \\leq 2010$ and any larger odd positive integer $m$ will give $T(m) \\geq T(n)>2010$.\n\nWe show that $N=309$ is the desired value of $N$ by showing that $T(309)>2010$ and $T(307) \\leq 2010$.\n\nCalculation of $T(309)$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{309}{3} \\leq c<\\frac{309}{2}$, so $103 \\leq c \\leq 154$.\n\nFor each admissible value of $c$, we need to count the number of pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b=309-c$.\n\nFor example, if $c=154$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 154$ and $a+b=155$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(1,154),(2,153), \\ldots,(76,79),(77,78)$, of which there are 77 .\n\nAlso, if $c=153$, then we need $a \\leq b \\leq 153$ and $a+b=156$.\n\nThis gives pairs $(3,153), \\ldots,(77,79),(78,78)$, of which there are 76 .\n\nIn general, if $c$ is even, then the minimum possible value of $a$ occurs when $b$ is as large as possible - that is, when $b=c$, so $a \\geq 309-2 c$.\n\nAlso, the largest possible value of $a$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close to equal as possible. Since $c$ is even, then $309-c$ is odd, so $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal, but they can differ by 1 .

The sums of these sets will not likely all be equal, but we then try to adjust the sums to by moving elements out of $A$ and $B$ into $C$ to try to make these sums equal. (Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.\n\nSince we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)\n\nCase 1: $n=6 k$\n\nIn this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .\n\n\n\nCase 2: $n=6 k+4$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 .

The largest odd number less than or equal to $n$ is $n-1$ if $n$ is even. The number of odd numbers up to $n-1$ is $\\frac{n}{2}$.

Thus, we have two entities to arrange, which can be done in $2! = 2$ ways (either the Bobby-Peter-Greg group comes first, followed by the Cindy-Jan-Marcia group, or vice versa).\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of acceptable lineups is $\\boxed{2}$."], "pred": ["2"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The divisors are: $1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17, 18, 34, 51, 102, 153, 306$. \n\nHowever, we need to check which of these divisors can actually be values of $k$ such that $306$ is in the sequence $S_k$. For each divisor $k$, we need to check if there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $k(1 + nk) = 306$. \n\nUpon checking, we find that the valid values of $k$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 17$. These are the values for which there exists a non-negative integer $n$ satisfying the equation. \n\nFinally, to find the sum of all such $k$, we add these values together: $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 17 = 38$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all $k$ such that 306 is an element of $S_k$ is $\\boxed{38}$."], "pred": ["38"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The case $b_{20}=a_{14}=2$ violates the requirement that the terms be distinct, and by reasoning analogous to the first case, $b_{20}=1, a_{14}=3$ is also impossible. Hence the sum $b_{20}+a_{14}$ is at least 10 . To show that 10 is attainable, make $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ decreasing and $b_{20}$ as small as possible: set $b_{20}=1, a_{14}=9$, and $a_{n}=23-n$.

{"idx": 366, "question": "An ARMLbar is a $7 \\times 7$ grid of unit squares with the center unit square removed. A portion of an ARMLbar is a square section of the bar, cut along the gridlines of the original bar. Compute the number of different ways there are to cut a single portion from an ARMLbar.", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "96", "unit": null, "solution": ["Note that any portion of side length $m \\geq 4$ will overlap the center square, so consider only portions of side length 3 or less. If there were no hole in the candy bar, the number of portions could be counted by conditioning on the possible location of the upper-left corner of the portion. If the portion is of size $1 \\times 1$, then the corner can occupy any of the $7^{2}$ squares of the bar. If the portion is of size $2 \\times 2$, then the corner can occupy any of the top 6 rows and any of the left 6 columns, for $6^{2}=36$ possible $2 \\times 2$ portions. In general, the upper-left corner of an $m \\times m$ portion can occupy any of the top $8-m$ rows and any of the left $8-m$ columns. So the total number of portions from an intact bar would be $7^{2}+6^{2}+5^{2}$. Now when $m \\leq 3$, the number of $m \\times m$ portions that include the missing square is simply $m^{2}$, because the missing square could be any square of the portion. So the net number of portions is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n7^{2}+6^{2}+5^{2}-3^{2}-2^{2}-1^{2} & =(49+36+25)-(9+4+1) \\\\\n& =110-14 \\\\\n& =\\mathbf{9 6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$", "First ignore the missing square. As in the previous solution, the number of $m \\times m$ portions that can fit in the bar is $(8-m)^{2}$. So the total number of portions of all sizes is simply\n\n$$\n7^{2}+6^{2}+\\cdots+1^{2}=\\frac{7(7+1)(2 \\cdot 7+1)}{6}=140\n$$\n\nTo exclude portions that overlap the missing center square, it is useful to consider the location of the missing square within the portion. If an $m \\times m$ portion includes the missing center\n\n\n\nsquare, and $m \\leq 4$, then the missing square could be any one of the $m^{2}$ squares in the portion. If $m=5$, then the missing square cannot be in the leftmost or rightmost columns of the portion, because then the entire bar would have to extend at least four squares past the hole, and it only extends three. By similar logic, the square cannot be in the top or bottom rows of the portion. So for $m=5$, there are $3 \\cdot 3=9$ possible positions. For $m=6$, the two left and two right columns are excluded, as are the two top and the two bottom rows, for $2 \\cdot 2=4$ possible positions for the portion.

We are interested in counting the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in this representation. To do this, we can look at the binary representations of $n$ and $n-1$.\n\n- Subtracting 1 from $n$ flips all the bits after the rightmost 1, including the rightmost 1 itself.

This is because for any given bit position, half of the numbers will have a 1 in that position in their binary representation.\n\nTherefore, each of the 7 bit positions contributes $256/2 = 128$ to the sum.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSince there are 7 bit positions contributing to the sum, and each contributes 128, the total sum is:\n\\[7 \\times 128 = 896\\]\n\nThus, the sum $C(1)+C(2)+\\cdots+C(256)$ is $\\boxed{896}$."], "pred": ["896"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 .

For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$. One such function $f$ is given below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccccccccccccc}\nn & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\\\\n\\hline f(n) & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 6 & 6 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 12 & 12 & 20\n\\end{array}\n$$"], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Algebra", "code": ["1. **Understanding the sequence $s_n$:**\n   The sequence $s_n$ is defined as $s_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\underbrace{(f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f)}_{n}(k)$. This means $s_n$ is the sum of the $n$-th iterate of $f$ applied to each element of $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$.\n\n2. **Behavior of $f$ and its iterates:**\n   Since $f$ maps $S$ to $S$, and $S$ is finite, the iterates of $f$ starting from any $k \\in S$ will eventually enter a cycle. This is due to the Pigeonhole Principle: there are only finitely many elements in $S$, so repeated application of $f$ must revisit some elements, leading to cycles.\n\n3. **Periodicity of $s_n$:**\n   Each term $f^n(k)$ in the sum defining $s_n$ will eventually become periodic. The period of $f^n(k)$ for any $k$ is at most the number of elements in $S$, which is 20. This is because the longest possible cycle in a permutation of 20 elements is of length 20.\n\n4. **Combining the periods:**\n   Since each $f^n(k)$ becomes periodic with a period of at most 20, the sum $s_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{20} f^n(k)$ will also become periodic. The period of $s_n$ is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the individual $f^n(k)$ terms.\n\n5. **Calculating the maximum possible period:**\n   The maximum period of any $f^n(k)$ is 20. The LCM of any set of numbers, each at most 20, is at most the LCM of the numbers from 1 to 20. We calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(1, 2, \\ldots, 20) = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19\n   \\]\n   This is the maximum possible period for the sequence $s_n$.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The sequence $s_n$ must become periodic, and the maximum possible period is given by the LCM of the numbers from 1 to 20. Therefore, the smallest integer $p$ such that the sequence $s_n$ is guaranteed to be periodic with a period at most $p$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19}\n   \\]"], "pred": ["2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot17\\cdot19"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The sum is $1+1+3+7=12$. A list with fewer than four numbers cannot produce a median and unique mode that are distinct from each other. To see this, first note that a list with one number has the same median and mode. In a list with two numbers, the mode is not unique if the numbers are different, and if the numbers are the same, the median and mode are equal. In a list of three numbers with a unique mode, the mode must occur twice. Hence the\n\n\n\nmode is equal to the middle number of the three, which is the median. Thus a list with a median and unique mode that are different from each other must contain at least four numbers.\n\nNow suppose that a list satisfying the given conditions sums to less than 12 . The mean must be greater than 1, and because the list contains at least four numbers, the mean must be exactly 2 . The median must also be greater than 1 , and if the mode is 4 , then the sum must be greater than 12 . Thus it remains to determine if a mean of 2 with mode 1 and median 3 can be achieved with a list of four or five positive integers.

Let's denote the mode as $m$, the median as $m+1$, and the mean as $m+2$. This is because the mode is the most frequently occurring number, and the median is the middle number when the list is ordered. The mean is the average of all the numbers.\n\n2. **List Construction**: To satisfy the condition of having a unique mode, we need at least two instances of the mode in the list. Additionally, to ensure the median is as small as possible, we include the smallest positive integer, which is $1$. Thus, our list starts with $1, m, m$. \n\n3. **Mean Calculation**: The mean of the list is given as $m+2$. To find the sum of the integers in the list, we use the formula for the mean, which is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers. If we have $n$ numbers in the list, the sum of these numbers is $n(m+2)$.\n\n4. **Sum and Count Relationship**: Since we already have three numbers ($1, m, m$) in the list, and we know the sum of all numbers is $n(m+2)$, we can express the sum of the remaining $n-3$ numbers as $n(m+2) - (2m+1)$.\n\n5. **Ensuring the Mode**: To keep $m$ as the unique mode, the sum of the remaining $n-3$ numbers must be greater than or equal to $(n-3)m$. This leads to the inequality $n(m+2) - (2m+1) \\ge (n-3)m$. Simplifying this, we find $n \\le 2m + 1$.\n\n6. **Minimizing the Sum**: To minimize the sum of the integers in the list, we aim to minimize $n(m+2)$. This can be achieved by choosing the smallest possible values for $m$ and $n$. \n\n7. **Choosing Values for $m$ and $n$**: If we set $m=2$, then $n$ can be at most $5$ (since $n \\le 2m + 1$). However, with $n=5$, the sum of the last two numbers would need to be $7$, which would either alter the mode or the median. \n\n8. **Finalizing the List**: By setting $m=2$ and $n=6$, we can construct a list that satisfies all conditions. The list $1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 10$ has a mode of $2$, a median of $2$ (since the middle two numbers are $2$ and $2$), and a mean of $3$ (since the sum of the numbers is $18$ and there are $6$ numbers, $18/6=3$).\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list, under the given conditions, is $\\boxed{18}$."], "pred": ["18"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The sum of its digits is $2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7$. We need to increase this sum to 17 while keeping the number as small as possible.\n\n1. **Incrementing the last digit**: If we increase the last digit (3) by 1, the sum of the digits becomes $7 + 1 = 8$. However, this is still far from 17. We can increment the last digit up to 9, which is the maximum value a single digit can have, resulting in a sum of $7 + (9 - 3) = 7 + 6 = 13$. This is closer but still not 17.\n\n2. **Carrying over to the next digit**: To reach a sum of 17, we need to carry over to the next digit. By setting the last digit to 9 and carrying over, we effectively increase the digit before it by 1. This action increases the sum of the digits by $10 - (3 - 9) = 10 + 6 = 16$. Adding this to the original sum of 7 gives us $7 + 16 = 23$. However, we have now exceeded our target sum of 17.\n\n3. **Adjusting the digits to reach the target sum**: To adjust the sum back to 17 from 23, we need to decrease it by $23 - 17 = 6$. We can achieve this by decreasing the second digit from the right (which was increased to 3 during the carry-over) by 6, setting it to $3 - 6 = -3$. However, since we cannot have negative digits, this step is conceptual and indicates that we need to find a way to reduce the sum by 6 without going into negative values.\n\n4. **Finding the correct configuration**: The correct approach is to set the last two digits to 9 (to maximize their contribution to the sum without exceeding the digit limit) and adjust the other digits accordingly. By setting the last two digits to 9, we add $9 + 9 = 18$ to the sum. To reach a total sum of 17, we need to reduce the sum of the other digits by $18 - 17 = 1$.

The largest integer $c$ such that $c^2 < 41$ is $c = 6$ (since $6^2 = 36$ and $7^2 = 49$ which is greater than 41).\n\n4. **Calculate Remaining Area for $a$ and $b$**: With $c = 6$, the remaining area for $a$ and $b$ is:\n   \\[\n   41 - 36 = 5\n   \\]\n   Thus, $a^2 + b^2 = 5$.\n\n5. **Determine Possible Values for $a$ and $b$**: The only integer solution for $a^2 + b^2 = 5$ with $a < b$ is $a = 1$ and $b = 2$ (since $1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$).\n\n6. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Enclosed Region**: The perimeter of the region is calculated by considering the outer edges of the squares. The largest square with side $c = 6$ contributes $4 \\times 6 = 24$ to the perimeter. The square with side $b = 2$ adds $2$ units to the perimeter on the top and right sides, and the square with side $a = 1$ adds $1$ unit to the perimeter on the top and right sides. However, we must subtract the overlapping segments where the smaller squares meet the larger square:\n   - The segment where $b$ meets $c$ on the right side is $2$ units.\n   - The segment where $a$ meets $c$ on the top side is $1$ unit.\n   - The segment where $a$ meets $b$ on the top side is $1$ unit.\n\n   Therefore, the total perimeter is:\n   \\[\n   24 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 - 2 - 1 - 1 = 24 + 6 - 4 = 26\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The largest possible perimeter of the region enclosed by the three squares is $\\boxed{26}$."], "pred": ["26"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

By the Angle Bisector Theorem:\n\\[\n\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1 \\implies AD = DC\n\\]\nThus, $AC = 2AD$.\n\n#### Step 3: Applying the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABD$\nUsing the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABD$:\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot BD \\cdot \\cos(\\angle ADB)\n\\]\nSince $\\angle ADB = 120^\\circ$ (as $\\angle B$ is trisected and $\\angle ABD = 60^\\circ$), $\\cos(120^\\circ) = -\\frac{1}{2}$, so:\n\\[\nx^2 = AD^2 + y^2 + AD \\cdot y\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Solving for $AD$\nRearranging the equation:\n\\[\nAD^2 + AD \\cdot y + y^2 - x^2 = 0\n\\]\nUsing the quadratic formula for $AD$:\n\\[\nAD = \\frac{-y \\pm \\sqrt{y^2 - 4(y^2 - x^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-y \\pm \\sqrt{4x^2 - 3y^2}}{2}\n\\]\nSince $AD$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\\[\nAD = \\frac{-y + \\sqrt{4x^2 - 3y^2}}{2}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Ensuring $AD$ is an integer\nFor $AD$ to be an integer, $4x^2 - 3y^2$ must be a perfect square. Let $4x^2 - 3y^2 = k^2$. Then:\n\\[\n4x^2 - k^2 = 3y^2 \\implies (2x - k)(2x + k) = 3y^2\n\\]\nGiven $x - y = 7$, we substitute $x = y + 7$:\n\\[\n4(y+7)^2 - 3y^2 = k^2 \\implies y^2 + 56y + 196 = k^2\n\\]\nThis is a Pell-like equation. Solving for $y$ and $k$, we find that $y = 13$ and $k = 21$ satisfy the equation.\n\n#### Step 6: Calculating $AC$\nWith $y = 13$, $x = y + 7 = 20$. Thus:\n\\[\nAD = \\frac{-13 + 21}{2} = 4 \\implies AC = 2AD = 8\n\\]\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe length of $AC$ is $\\boxed{14}$."], "pred": ["14"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Now $\\odot A$ and $\\odot B$ intersect at two points, but one of them is $C$, so the other intersection must be the location of $P$, which is $P_{5}$. The condition $P B=A B$ is impossible, because it implies that $A B=B C$, which is false because in $\\triangle A B C, \\mathrm{~m} \\angle C>\\mathrm{m} \\angle A=20^{\\circ}$, so $A B>B C$. The third possibility for $\\triangle P A B$ is that $P A=P B$, implying that the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ intersects $\\odot B$, which only occurs if $B C / A B \\geq 1 / 2$ (although if $B C / A B=1 / 2$, the triangle is degenerate). But $B C / A B=2 \\cos 80^{\\circ}$, and the given approximation $\\cos 80^{\\circ} \\approx 0.17$ implies that $B C / A B \\approx 0.34$. Hence the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{A B}$ does not intersect $\\odot B$. Thus the assumption $P B=B C$ yields only one additional location for $P, P_{5}$.

If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase. This means that $f$ is actually constant on the half-closed interval $\\left(\\frac{n-1}{3}, \\frac{n}{3}\\right]$. If neither $n$ nor $n+1$ are multiples of 9 , then $l_{n+1}=l_{n}+1$.

Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

There are three pairs of opposite faces on a cube, so there are 3 ways to choose which pair will be red.\n\n**Step 5: Coloring the Remaining Faces**\n\nAfter choosing the red pair, the colors of the remaining faces are determined. The two faces adjacent to the red pair on one side must be blue, and the two faces adjacent on the other side must also be blue to avoid having three red faces meeting at a vertex.\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Probability**\n\nSince there are 3 ways to achieve the desired coloring out of a total of 64 possible colorings, the probability is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Desired Colorings}}{\\text{Total Number of Colorings}} = \\frac{3}{64} \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{64}}$."], "pred": ["\\frac{3}{64}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

The number of ways to choose 5 digits from 10 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{10}{5}$.

Since these three digits must be in strictly decreasing order, and there are 3 digits to arrange, there are $3! = 6$ possible arrangements of any three digits.

Since each switch is flipped exactly once in our 3-minute scenario, the total number of flips for each switch is odd (specifically, 1 flip).\n\n4. **Contradiction**: However, for a switch to be on at the end of the puzzle, it must be flipped an odd number of times (since it starts off and needs to end up on).

Since 1993 is odd, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of switches that are on will change each minute. This is because flipping an odd number of switches will change the parity of the count of switches that are on.\n\n#### Step 3: Calculating the Minimum Time\nWe need to find the smallest number of minutes such that all 2020 switches are on.

We need to verify this by checking if it is possible to have all switches on after 14 minutes.\n\n- In 14 minutes, the total number of flips is $14 \\times 1993$.\n- We need to check if this is sufficient to turn all 2020 switches on.\n\n#### Step 5: Verifying the Calculation\n- After 14 minutes, the total number of flips is $14 \\times 1993 = 27902$.\n- Since each switch is flipped an odd number of times, and 1993 is odd, the parity of the number of switches that are on will change each minute.\n- After 14 minutes, since 14 is even, the parity of the number of switches that are on will be the same as the initial state (all off), but since each switch has been flipped an odd number of times, they will all be on.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThus, the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape the room by having all 2020 switches on, given that she flips 1993 switches each minute, is indeed 14 minutes.\n\n$\\boxed{14}$"], "pred": ["14"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

If it's impossible, $E(2001, 501) = \\infty$.\n\n#### Step 2: Parity Analysis\nEach switch must be flipped an odd number of times to be on. Since 501 is odd, flipping 501 switches each minute will result in an odd number of flips for each switch if the total number of flips (over all minutes) is odd. This is because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd.\n\n#### Step 3: Total Flips\nIf Elizabeth flips 501 switches each minute for $m$ minutes, the total number of flips is $501m$. For all switches to be on, $501m$ must be odd, implying $m$ must be odd (since 501 is odd).\n\n#### Step 4: Minimum $m$\nWe need to find the smallest odd $m$ such that $501m \\geq 2001$. Solving $501m = 2001$ gives $m = \\frac{2001}{501} \\approx 4$. Since $m$ must be odd and greater than or equal to 4, the smallest possible $m$ is 5.\n\n#### Step 5: Verification\nWe need to verify if $m = 5$ is sufficient. If $m = 5$, then $501 \\times 5 = 2505$ flips are made. Since 2505 is odd, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, all switches can be on after 5 minutes.\n\n#### Step 6: Constructing a Solution\nWe need to show a sequence of flips that results in all switches being on after 5 minutes. We can divide the 2001 switches into 5 groups of 400 switches and one group of 1 switch. Each minute, flip all switches in one of the 400-switch groups and the single switch in the last group. After 5 minutes, each of the 400-switch groups will have been flipped once, and the single switch will have been flipped 5 times, all resulting in an odd number of flips.\n\n#### Conclusion\nSince we have shown that it is possible to have all switches on after 5 minutes and that 5 is the minimum number of minutes required, we conclude that $E(2001, 501) = 5$.\n\n$\\boxed{5}$"], "pred": ["5"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

This means she must change the switches she flips each minute.\n\n2. **Strategy for 2 Minutes**: If Elizabeth uses only 2 minutes, she can flip 6 switches in total (3 switches per minute). However, since there are only 6 switches and she must flip different switches each minute to avoid toggling the same switch back to off, it's impossible to ensure all switches are on after 2 minutes because she would have to flip each switch exactly once, which doesn't guarantee all switches end up on.\n\n3. **Strategy for 3 Minutes**: To ensure all switches are on, Elizabeth can adopt a strategy that involves flipping different combinations of switches over 3 minutes. One such strategy is to divide the 6 switches into 3 groups of 2 switches each and flip the switches in two of these groups each minute. For example, she could flip switches 1 and 2 in the first minute, switches 3 and 4 in the second minute, and switches 5 and 6 in the third minute.

Thus the answer is $\\mathbf{1 2}$."], "answer_type": "Numerical", "subfield": "Combinatorics", "code": ["To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie, where each selfie can have either two or three students. Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Counting Pairs**: First, we calculate the total number of pairs among the eight students. This can be done using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of students. For $n=8$, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n   \\]\n   So, there are 28 unique pairs of students.\n\n2. **Selfies with Two Students**: If we only consider selfies with two students, each selfie will cover exactly one pair. Therefore, to cover all 28 pairs, we would need 28 selfies. However, this does not consider the possibility of selfies with three students, which can cover multiple pairs in a single photo.\n\n3. **Introducing Three-Student Selfies**: A selfie with three students covers $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs. If we include selfies with three students, we can reduce the total number of selfies needed. For example, if we have $k$ selfies with three students, these will cover $3k$ pairs. The remaining pairs will need to be covered by two-student selfies.\n\n4. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Selfies**: To minimize the total number of selfies, we maximize the number of three-student selfies. If we have $k$ three-student selfies, we cover $3k$ pairs, leaving $28 - 3k$ pairs to be covered by two-student selfies. The total number of selfies is then $k + (28 - 3k)$. We want to find the smallest $k$ such that $28 - 3k$ is non-negative and as small as possible.\n\n5. **Finding the Optimal $k$**: The optimal $k$ is found when $28 - 3k$ is minimized but still non-negative. This occurs when $k = 8$, as $28 - 3 \\times 8 = 28 - 24 = 4$. Thus, with 8 three-student selfies, we cover $3 \\times 8 = 24$ pairs, leaving 4 pairs to be covered by two-student selfies.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum number of selfies needed, with the optimal distribution of two-student and three-student selfies, is $8 + 4 = 12$. This ensures each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie.\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{12}\n   \\]"], "pred": ["12"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

In this case, $n=16$ and $r=39$, but since we are choosing all but 3 cards (16 - 3 = 13), we can equivalently calculate this as $\\binom{16}{3}$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose a set that contains exactly three aces from these 16 cards is the number of ways to choose the 3 non-aces from the 12 available, which is $\\binom{12}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Emile's set contains exactly three aces is the ratio of these two combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{12}{3}}{\\binom{16}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!}}{\\frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!}} = \\frac{\\frac{12!}{3!9!}}{\\frac{16!}{3!13!}} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{16 \\times 15 \\times 14} = \\frac{11}{28}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that Emile's set contains exactly three aces is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{28}}$."], "pred": ["\\frac{11}{28}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

This formula is derived from the fact that an $n$-gon can be divided into $n-2$ triangles, and since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180$ degrees, the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.\n\nGiven that the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon equals the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon plus the sum of the interior angles of an octagon, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n\\[\n180(n-2) = 180(5-2) + 180(8-2)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n180(n-2) = 180 \\cdot 3 + 180 \\cdot 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n180(n-2) = 540 + 1080\n\\]\n\n\\[\n180(n-2) = 1620\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by $180$ to solve for $n-2$, we get:\n\n\\[\nn-2 = \\frac{1620}{180}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn-2 = 9\n\\]\n\nAdding $2$ to both sides to solve for $n$, we find:\n\n\\[\nn = 9 + 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nn = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{11}$."], "pred": ["11"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
