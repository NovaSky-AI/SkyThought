Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the maximum amount Carlos can spend after including the sales tax:**\n\nCarlos has $43, and he needs to pay a $7.5\\%$ sales tax on the discounted price of the shoes. To find out how much he can spend before tax, we divide the total amount he has by $1 +$ the sales tax rate (in decimal form). The sales tax rate is $7.5\\%$, which is $0.075$ in decimal form. So, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{43}{1 + 0.075} = \\frac{43}{1.075} \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the calculation:**\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $1000$ to avoid dealing with decimals:\n\n\\[ \\frac{43 \\times 1000}{1.075 \\times 1000} = \\frac{43000}{1075} \\]\n\n3. **Reduce the fraction:**\n\nWe can reduce this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $25$:\n\n\\[ \\frac{43000 \\div 25}{1075 \\div 25} = \\frac{1720}{43} \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the maximum discounted price:**\n\nNow, we know that Carlos can afford shoes that cost $\\frac{1720}{43}$ dollars after the $20\\%$ discount. Since the shoes are discounted by $20\\%$, Carlos is paying $80\\%$ (or $0.8$) of the original price. To find the original price, we divide the maximum discounted price by $0.8$:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1720}{43 \\times 0.8} = \\frac{1720}{34.4} \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the final calculation:**\n\nTo simplify the final calculation, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $5$ to avoid dealing with decimals:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1720 \\times 5}{34.4 \\times 5} = \\frac{8600}{172} \\]\n\n6. **Find the maximum original price:**\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction to find the maximum original price of the shoes Carlos could afford:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8600}{172} = \\boxed{50} \\]\n\nTherefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $\\boxed{50}$ dollars."], "pred": ["50"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
