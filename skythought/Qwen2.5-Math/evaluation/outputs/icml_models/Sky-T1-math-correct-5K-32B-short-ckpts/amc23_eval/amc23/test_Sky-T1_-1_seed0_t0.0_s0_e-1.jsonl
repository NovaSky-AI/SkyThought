This symmetry allows us to focus on one quadrant, specifically the first quadrant where $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, and then extend our findings to the entire plane.\n\n2. **Simplifying the Inequality in the First Quadrant**: In the first quadrant, the absolute values can be simplified because $x$ and $y$ are non-negative. The inequality becomes $||x|-1| + ||y|-1| = |x-1| + |y-1| \\le 1$. This simplification is crucial for understanding the shape of the region in this quadrant.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Simplified Inequality**: The simplified inequality $|x-1| + |y-1| \\le 1$ describes a diamond (or a square rotated by 45 degrees) centered at $(1,1)$ with a side length of $\\sqrt{2}$. This is because the inequality represents all points $(x,y)$ that are at a \"Manhattan distance\" of 1 or less from the point $(1,1)$.\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Diamond**: The area of a square (which is what the diamond is, rotated) is given by the side length squared. Since the side length of our square is $\\sqrt{2}$, the area of the diamond in the first quadrant is $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\n\n5. **Extending to the Entire Plane**: Due to the symmetry of the region with respect to both axes, the region in the first quadrant is replicated in each of the other three quadrants. Therefore, to find the total area of the region defined by the original inequality, we multiply the area of the diamond in the first quadrant by 4.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: The total area of the region is $4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ is $\\boxed{8}$."], "pred": ["8"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}
